AB Hydrogen is a main factor in cold cracking or hydrogen-induced cracking. The most crack susceptible region of a steel welded joint is the heat affected zone (HAZ). The formulation and functional-analytical solution of the one-dimensional problem of hydrogen diffusion in an inhomogeneous butt-welded joint considering weld and joint dimensions and initial hydrogen distribution as well as hydrogen diffusion coefficients and solubilities are presented. It is shown that the peak hydrogen concentration in the HAZ of inhomogeneous joints varies in direct proportion to the initial hydrogen concentration in the weld metal. It is inversely proportional to the ratio of hydrogen solubilities in the weld metal and the HAZ metal and is nonlinear in the diffusion coefficient ratio of these metals. The peak hydrogen concentration in the HAZ can exceed 170% of the average initial concentration in the joint if martensitic steel is welded using low-carbon low-alloy welding consumables. The utilization of austenitic consumables leads to a dramatic reduction in the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ in comparison with the non-austenitic consumables. No direct relationship was found between the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ and the hydrogen evolution from the joint surface.

AB In this study, linear friction welding is applied to join JIS-S45C medium carbon steel with ferrite and pearlite structures at temperatures above and below the A1 point. Additionally, low-strain-rate tensile tests are conducted both in air and with a cathodic hydrogen charge to evaluate the hydrogen-embrittlement susceptibility of the linear friction-welded joints under both joining conditions. Results of hydrogen ther-mal-desorption analysis show that the hydrogen-charging conditions in this study simulated atmospheric corrosion conditions. The joining zone of the above-A1 joint comprises fine martensite and ferrite, whereas that for the below-A1 joint comprises ultrafine ferrite and cementite. In air tensile tests, both joints frac-tured in the base-metal region, thus suggesting the high reliability of the joints. In the hydrogen-charged tensile test, the above-A1 joints exhibit premature fracture at the joining zone. By contrast, the below-A1joints exhibit base-metal fractures, thus suggesting that the joints are highly reliable in a hydrogen environ-ment. Fracture-surface observations show that the above-A1 joints exhibit cleavage fractures in the martensite-dominated region. Tensile tests on heat-treated martensite S45C specimens show that their fracture strength decreased significantly in a hydrogen environment. Therefore, the joint fracture is due to the significant decrease in the fracture strength of martensite formed in the above-A1 joints in the hydro-gen environment. The linear friction-welded medium carbon steel joints below the A1 temperature can ensure reliability even in a hydrogen environment

AB The electrochemical behavior of the weld metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and base material of super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) welded joints, made with the application of flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) and submerged arc welding (SAW), were investigated with the use of metallographic examinations (optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy), potentiodynamic polarization measurements and total hydrogen content determination in the initial state and after hydrogen charging. The obtained results revealed that the effect of hydrogen depended on the microstructure and type of the region of a welded joint. The highest amount of hydrogen penetrated the welded joint charged at 1mAcm(-2). It was observed in case of the FCAW-welded joint, made with lower heat input. The electrochemical measurements showed that the base material was the most corrosion resistant part of the welded joint while the hydrogen charging strongly changed pitting and general corrosion susceptibility of HAZ and weld metal of both welded joints.

AB The abundance and uneven distribution of renewable energy might cause congestion and curtailment in electric power systems. Transmission expansions can potentially alleviate transmission congestion and reduce renewable energy curtailment. On the other hand, with the substantial cost reduction of electrolyzer technology and the continuing rise of hydrogen demand, converting surplus renewable energy to hydrogen provides synergistic benefits to power and hydrogen systems, but consequently requires joint planning of the two systems. To this end, we propose a joint planning approach for power transmission and hydrogen transportation networks to coordinately optimize the investment and operation of power and hydrogen infrastructure. In our proposed model, detailed truck routing, pipeline, and hydrogen storage are formulated to quantify the flexibility of hydrogen transportation system. A robust joint planning approach is also proposed to address various uncertainties from renewable energy, electric load, and hydrogen demand. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed joint planning model can save the total system cost, reduce renewable energy curtailment, and increase the utilization level of transmission lines.

AB The study investigates the microstructural evolution and susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement in laserwelded joints of oxidation-resistant press-hardened steel. During the press hardening process, the base material underwent a transformation from a recrystallized structure to martensite, accompanied by significant reductions in average grain size and dislocation density across various regions of the welded joint. These changes resulted in notable differences in hydrogen-trapping sites between the welded joint and the base material. Irreversible hydrogen traps were observed exclusively in the base material, while the laser-welded joint demonstrated a high susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, leading to hydrogen-induced delayed fracture. Intergranular and quasi-cleavage fractures were identified as the dominant failure modes in the welded joint. The underlying mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement in the welded joint was attributed to a synergistic interaction between hydrogen-enhanced decohesion and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement behavior of two low-carbon medium manganese steel welding joints was elucidated using a slow strain rate tensile experiment, hydrogen permeation experiment, and hydrogen concentration test. The fracture starting position becomes heat-affected zone (HAZ) after hydrogen charging. The hydrogen concentration of HAZ is higher than weld material (WM) for two welding joints after hydrogen charging for both 1 h and 2 h. The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the welding joint with high hydrogen concentration, which contains about 0.03 Ti in both WM and HAZ, is larger than the welding joint that does not contain Ti. When the hydrogen charging time of the Ti-contained welding joints increases from 1 h to 2 h, the fractography of WM changes from small shallow dimples (hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity) to quasi-cleavage and cleavage (hydrogen enhanced decohesion), and the fractography of HAZ changes from quasi-cleavage (hydrogen enhanced decohesion) to intergranular (hydrogen enhanced decohesion).

AB Hydrogen diffusion coefficients of different regions in the welded joint of X80 pipeline steel were measured using the electro-chemical permeation technique. Using ABAQUS software, hydrogen diffusion in X80 pipeline steel welded joint was studied in consideration of the inhomogeneity of the welding zone, and temperature-dependent thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the metals. A three dimensional finite element model was developed and a coupled thermo-mechanical-diffusion analysis was performed. Hydrogen concentration distribution across the welded joint was obtained. It is found that the postweld residual hydrogen exhibits a non-uniform distribution across the welded joint. A maximum equivalent stress occurs in the immediate vicinity of the weld metal. The heat affected zone has the highest hydrogen concentration level, followed by the weld zone and the base metal. Simulation results are well consistent with theoretical analysis.

AB Hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) behavior and mechanism of E690 welded joint in simulated seawater were studied via microstructure observations, electrochemical hydrogen charging, slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests and hydrogen content measurement. The results show that the welded joint of E690 steel has a higher HIC susceptibility than that of base metal, in which the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) is composed of polygonal ferrite and granular bainite is the final fracture location in the joint. ICHAZ with the lowest yield strength deformed preferentially under the tensile stress, and subsequently, the proliferating dislocations with the deformation strengthening and the continuously charged hydrogen led to the HIC and brittle fracture at the ICHAZ of the welded joint. Moreover, the HIC susceptibility was linearly dependent on the logarithm of total hydrogen concentration in the steel, and the hydrogen concentration had a more obvious effect on the welded joint than the base metal. The higher density of piled dislocations adjoining the M/A islands in the welded joint exhibited a significant effect on the hydrogen agglomeration and diffusion, which enhanced the HIC susceptibility.

AB In order to evaluate the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement(HE) of the L360MH hydrogen transportation pipeline, through electrochemical hydrogen charging (H-charging), mechanical property tests, microstructures and fracture analysis, the longitudinal and girth weld of the straight seam welding pipeline was assessed carefully. The conclusions indicate that both submerged arc welding (SAW) welded joint and tungsten inert-gas welding (TIG) welded joint exhibit high-strength matching characteristics, the strength of the SAW welded joint is about 10 % higher than that of the base metal (BM), while the strength of the (TIG) welded joint has increased by about 17 %, softening was observed in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the SAW welded joint, with about 9 % reduction in tensile strength compared to the BM. Upon H-charging, the HAZ of welded joints demonstrate a heightened susceptibility to HE. In contrast, the susceptibility to HE of the BM is nearly identical to that of the weld metal (WM), while the HAZ of the TIG welded joint is more susceptible to HE than the SAW welded joint. It has been found that there is a positive correlation between the quantity of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM), and the susceptibility to HE within the microstructure of welded joints. The fracture surface of the WM and HAZ of welded joints after H-charging exhibits a "fish-eye" river pattern with inclusions in the center area, as well as tear ridges and cleavage steps among other patterns.

AB The effects of fatigue damage on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity of X80 steel welded joints, obtained using flux-cored arc welding method, were investigated in the study. Results show that both the yield and tensile strength increased for all the hydrogencharged welded joints and decreased with the accumulation of fatigue damage. The fracture surface is the mixture of local quasi-cleavage (QC) surrounded by shallow dimples ductile fracture for hydrogen-charged welded joints, whilst that of hydrogen-free welded joint is typical dimple ductile fracture. The presence of fisheye morphology might be related to the hydrogen, local strain accumulation in the vicinity of inclusions and dislocations evolution caused by the cyclic load. The mechanism is the synergistic action of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). However, the pinning effect of hydrogen on the dislocation motion is the dominant role. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue affecting the structural integrity of materials, including welded joints, used in hydrogen storage and transportation. In this study, the influence of HE on the fatigue behavior of 316L austenitic stainless-steel welded joints was investigated. Tensile and fatigue tests were performed on base material, welded joints, and hydrogen-charged welded joints to assess the degradation in their mechanical properties. The results revealed that welding significantly reduced the fatigue strength of the material, and the presence of hydrogen further intensified this effect. Microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of austenitic-ferritic duplex microstructures in the weld bead, with delta ferrite improving resistance to hot cracking but increasing susceptibility to HE. Fractographic examination of weld beads exposed to hydrogen charging showed characteristic hydrogen-induced cracking.

AB The distribution of diffusion hydrogen in the welded joints of high-strength X80 pipeline steel was investigated using finite element method. Using ABAQUS software, hydrogen diffusion in X80 pipeline steel welded joint was studied in consideration of the inhomogeneity of the weld zone, and temperature-dependent thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the metals. The effects of preheating procedure and welding heat input on the hydrogen diffusion behavior were studied. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed and coupled thermo-mechanical-diffusion analyses under different welding conditions were performed. It is found that the postweld residual hydrogen exhibits a non-uniform distribution across the welded joint. A maximum equivalent stress occurs in the immediate vicinity of the weld metal. The heat affected zone has the highest hydrogen concentration level, followed by the welding zone and the base metal. Both preheating and increasing heat input are effective in reducing the diffusion hydrogen content remaining in the weld zone for the X80 pipeline steel welded joints. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB The effect of hydrogen on the pitting susceptibility of 2205 duplex stainless steel welded joints was investigated using metallographic characterisation, electrochemical techniques and immersion experiments. The results show that the diffusible hydrogen content in the welded joints is approximately twice that of base material (BM). Hydrogen significantly decreases the pitting potential (Epit) of the welded joints, while increasing the carrier density in the passive film, suggesting that hydrogen weakens the protective properties of the passive film and increases the pitting susceptibility of the welded joints. According to immersion experiments, the pitting susceptibility of the welded joint from high to low is heat-affected zone (HAZ), BM and weld metal (WM), the HAZ tends to be more prone to the formation of larger and more stable pits, and the number of inclusions at the HAZ is significantly greater than that at the BM and WM. For BM under hydrogen charging, austenite phase is usually corroded first, because hydrogen tends to be enriched in the austenitic phase of BM. However, in some regions of WM, ferrite phase corroded first, which is related to the enrichment of hydrogen in the ferrite in the weld area.

AB The interaction between fatigue damage and hydrogen in TC4 welded joints was analyzed considering specimens with different pre-cycles. The fracture failure caused by hydrogen-induced fatigue damage was investigated using tensile testing and microstructural observations. The results indicate that increasing the number of pre-cycles increases the specimens' initial dislocation density, enhancing the severity of the hydrogen-induced embrittlement phenomenon. The hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity mechanism, manifested by fracture along the grain boundary, dominates the tensile process in fatigue-damaged hydrogen-filled welded joints after 10,000 and 20,000 pre-cycles. After 30,000 pre-cycles, the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion mechanism dominates the tensile process, manifesting as a transgranular cleavage decoupling fracture.

AB Both adjustable hydropower and hydrogen power present viable solutions to address the intermittency and fluctuations of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic power. To complement non-schedulable renewables, previous studies have individually explored the operating strategies of hydropower or hydrogen power. However, the joint operating rules of hydropower and hydrogen power have seldom been investigated, primarily due to the complex reciprocal relationship between multiple adjustable power sources. This study aims to develop the joint operating rules for hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid energy systems (HESs). First, a deterministic optimal operation model is built to optimize both the operation benefit and assurance rate. Subsequently, the operation decisions are synthesized to identify reference values of operation rules' parameters, with crosscorrelation analysis aiding in the identification of the proper decision variables. Finally, operating rules' parameters are optimized through the direct policy search method. Results from a case study using China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic HES indicate that the reservoir release emerges as the most influential decision variable for formulating joint operating rules. Notably, the joint operating rules outperform conventional methods, yielding a 16.93% improvement in annual operational benefits and a 7.31% increase in assurance rates. These findings underscore the substantial enhancements in energy use efficiency facilitated by the proposed joint operating rules.

   zone; Hydrogen; Cold cracking
AB Over the last decades, press hardening or hot forming has become all pervasive for automotive body-in-white design. Press-hardened boron-microalloyed steels are widely used in modern body structure for high safety standard and lightweight achievement. Considering the welding of press-hardened components, some special considerations have to be taken into account compared to conventional deep-drawing steel grades. The welding process results in a significant hardness drop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) which may lead to a change in failure mode or premature failure. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the welded joints are influenced by the weld metal hydrogen content. Hydrogen pickup of press-hardened steel may result from the heat treatment or the welding process. Due to the martensitic microstructure and the high strength level, a critical hydrogen content may cause hydrogen embrittlement or hydrogen-assisted cold cracking (HACC). This paper contributes to the determination of the diffusible hydrogen content in resistance spot-welded and gas metal arc-welded joints of press-hardened boron-microalloyed steel. It also promotes the understanding of the effect of diffusible hydrogen on the mechanical properties of those joints. Hydrogen was deliberately introduced during welding by wetting of the sheet surface with hydrogenated fluids. The hydrogen content in the weld metal was quantified by thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TDMS) technique. Finally, the influence on the mechanical properties of the welded joints was determined based on a simple component test. A GMA-welded component was set under a constant static load and evaluated for delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking.

TI Effect of ultrasonic surface rolling process on hydrogen embrittlement
   behavior of TC4 laser welded joints
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE

ID TITANIUM; STRESS
AB Some key structural parts made of welding titanium alloys usually serve in hydrogen environment in aerospace, ship building and chemical industries. To investigate the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behaviors of the welded titanium alloy joints and the impact factors, the TC4 titanium alloy joints welded by laser welding method were first treated by ultrasonic surface rolling process (USRP). Then, slow-rate tensile tests were conducted under electrochemical hydrogen charging condition to compare the mechanical properties of the TC4 laser welded joints before and after USRP. On this basis, the HE behaviors and mechanisms of the USRP-treated TC4 laser welded joint and the USRP-untreated one were discussed in detail. The results show that USRP could significantly improve the anti-hydrogen embrittlement behaviors of the TC4 laser welded joint, which could be attributed to the grain refinement and residual compressive stress in the deformation layer induced by USRP. The results of this paper provide a theoretical basis for the design of anti-hydrogen embrittlement metal materials.

AB The safe service of reeled-pipeline welded joint subjected to multiple cyclic plastic deformation (CPD) is challenged by hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the process of gas and petroleum transportation. Therefore, this work aims to study the interrelation of hydrogen and the ductility of X65 reeled-pipeline welded joint with CPD by using electrochemical hydrogen charging. The results showed that hydrogen could lead to the ductility degradation, regardless of whether the CPD process was performed. But the hydrogen-induced ductility degradation for the welded joint with CPD was retarded. When the hydrogen-charging current density was 50 mA/cm(2), the hydrogen embrittlement index (I-UE) based on the uniform elongation for welded joint with CPD was 0.33, while that of as-welded joint was 0.53, which indicated that CPD process reduced the sensitivity to HE. The morphology of tensile fracture indicated that brittle cracks initiated at the composite oxide inclusion enriched Al-Mg-Ca-S elements, and propagated radially by quasi-cleavage fracture pattern. The CPD process led to the increase of dislocations acting as reversible hydrogen traps, which significantly enhanced the hydrogen content of welded joint from 1.001 ppm to 2.516 ppm. However, the dislocation walls and cells related to the CPD process hindered the diffusion of hydrogen, and homogeneous distribution of dislocations after CPD dispersed trap sites for capturing hydrogen, which played important roles in delaying hydrogen-induced fracture.

AB Blending green hydrogen into natural gas can effectively promote hydrogen consumption and operational flexibility of electricity-gas coupled networks. However, the volatility of renewable energy sources threatens the operation of green hydrogen production and blending, while existing system-level risk management methods either exhibit over-conservatism or are computationally inefficient when constraints are numerous. Therefore, this paper proposes a correlation-enhanced distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) method for the joint scheduling of electricity and hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (E-HCNG) networks, aiming to minimize operating cost while limiting joint violation risk under renewable energy uncertainty. Specifically, before DRJCC, an improved hydrogen fraction model is developed for hydrogen blending, refining the representation of fraction variations by incorporating the buffer effect of line packs. Then, for DRJCC solving, the commonly used Bonferroni approximations are overly conservative in allocating joint violation risks to individual chance constraints, especially when constraints are numerous. To mitigate this, by leveraging strongly violation correlations of operational constraints under affine policies, a grouping-based risk allocation strategy is proposed to reduce the over-conservatism. Theoretical derivations confirm the guarantee of joint violation risk via the proposed method. Additionally, customized transformations are developed to address the non-convexities introduced by variable hydrogen fractions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB This paper describes an experimental hydrogenating treatment on a Ti-6Al-4V fatigue specimen containing an electron beam welding joint. The effect of trace solute hydrogen on the microstructures and fatigue behavior of welded Ti-6Al-4V alloy joints was investigated using an optical microscope, X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and other methodologies. The results demonstrated that no hydride formed in the hydrogenated weld joint at a hydrogen concentration of less than 0.140 wt%. Internal hydrogen, which was present in the alloy in the form of solid solution atoms, caused lattice distortion in the 13 phase. The fatigue properties of the Ti-6Al-4V weld joint hydrogenated with trace solute hydrogen decreased significantly. The solute hydrogen led to an increase in the brittleness of the hydrogenated weld joint. The dislocation densities in the secondary a and beta phase were higher. Fatigue cracks nucleated at the alpha/beta interfaces. The effect of solute hydrogen accelerated the separation of the persistent slip bands, which decreased the threshold required for fatigue crack growth. Solute hydrogen also accelerated the fatigue crack growth rate. These two factors contributed to the degradation of the fatigue life in the electron beam welded Ti-6Al-4V alloy joints.

AB In this research, the microstructure, electrochemical hydrogen permeation properties, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) characteristics, hydrogen diffusion and trapping behavior in different micro-regions of L360QS pipeline welded joints were systematically investigated. The results prove that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the L360QS pipeline steel welded joints exhibits the highest effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient and the largest amount of diffusible hydrogen compared with those in the weld metal and base metal. The tendency of hydrogen diffusion and accumulation in the HAZ is closely related to the presence of more straight grain boundaries. The straight grain boundaries permit an increase in effective hydrogen diffusion and equilibrium hydrogen concentration. The high grain densities of base metal in fine grains would hinder hydrogen diffusion, resulting in a lower effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient. Due to the presence of polygonal ferrite, pearlite, and granular bainite with a significant number of irreversible hydrogen traps for the weld metal,it hinders hydrogen diffusion and lead to the decrease of diffusible hydrogen content. This research provides a fundamental understanding of hydrogen diffusion behavior which will support the optimization of welding processes for L360QS pipeline in hydrogen-rich environments.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement (HE) mechanism of QP980 steels laser welded joints with complex microstructures is unclear. The joint with hydrogen pre-charging fractured at the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) in slow strain rate tensile test, and the relative loss of elongation amounted to 84.8 %. Hydrogen-induced microcracks mainly initiated inside martensite (similar to 60 %). Hydrogen-induced crack propagation paths of the joint were transgranular propagation of martensite and intergranular propagation of ferrite/martensite interface. The HE mechanism of the joint was the combination of the effects in hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE).

Both the notched tensile strength (NTS) and reduction in area (RA) are reduced in hydrogen environments, with the most pronounced ductility loss and brittle fracture characteristics observed in the WM, followed by the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM). Hydrogen exposure leads to a 52.8 % reduction in the fracture toughness of the WM, accompanied by the presence of pronounced secondary cracks on the fracture surface. Microstructural, fractographic, and mechanical analyses revealed that the high hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the WM is associated with its microstructural heterogeneity (including acicular ferrite, quasipolygonal ferrite, hard phases such as martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents), the presence of inclusions, and the pronounced anisotropy, all of which contribute to making the WM the most vulnerable region to hydrogen embrittlement.

In the original joint with hydrogen pre-charging, cleavage fracture occurred at the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ). The IPC process only caused carbides to precipitate in martensite of the ICHAZ. The IPC joint with hydrogen pre-charging (5 min) exhibited ductile fracture at the base material during the slow strain rate tensile test, and the total elongation HE sensitivity of the joint was reduced from 84.6 % to 13.7 %.

Results of threshold stress tests (according to the ASTM E1681 standard) and slow strain rate tension tests (SSRT) of pipe metal in hydrogen and hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures at a pressure of 10 MPa are presented. Steel structure and Vickers hardness distribution along a subcritical crack front are investigated for specimens after crack resistance tests. Structural features of pipe base metal and welded joint metal (weld metal and heat-affected zone), which may affect pipe steel hydrogen embrittlement and values obtained for crack growth during crack resistance tests are considered.

AB To date, the hydrogen diffusion mechanism in the welded joint of high strength steels is poorly understood. A thermal-mechanical-hydrogen diffusion sequentially coupled procedure was built to investigate the hydrogen diffusion behaviors during the whole welding process with considering the nonlinearity of the material and the effects of the phase transformations. By using this modelling, the dehydrogenation of the welding conditions were comparably studied. A first-time numerically observed self-gathering effect occurred during the transformation of undercooled austenite in the cooling process, which caused a hydrogen concentration jump even larger than the initial concentration of the molten pool at the bottom of the weld metal. That significantly influenced the subsequent hydrogen diffusion of the whole welded joint. The retained hydrogen was dominantly driven by the normalized concentration difference. Surprisingly, the stress-assisted diffusion was limited in the joint unless the hydrogen concentration was at a very low level. The hydrogen concentration in both weld metal and heat affect zone should be treated with caution for preventing the hydrogen assisted cold cracking. The results also indicate that there is a more economical and energy saving treatment in contrast with the over conservative ones commonly used in engineering.

AB Over the last decade, press hardening has become all pervasive for automotive body-in-white design. Press-hardened boron micro-alloyed steels are widely used in modern body structure for high safety standard and lightweight achievement. Considering the welding of press-hardened components, some special considerations have to be taken into account compared to conventional deep-drawing steel grades. The mechanical properties of the welded joints are influenced by the hydrogen content in the base metal as well as the weld metal. Hydrogen absorption may result from the press-hardening process, as well as the welding process. Due to the martensitic microstructure and the high strength level, a critical hydrogen content may cause hydrogen embrittlement or hydrogen-assisted cold cracking (HACC). This paper focuses on the determination of the diffusible hydrogen content in the base metal after the press-hardening process, as well as in gas metal arc (GMA) welded joints of 22MnB5. Hydrogen source during press hardening is the humidity at the austenitizing temperature in the furnace atmosphere. During welding, for this study hydrogen was deliberately introduced by hydrogenous fluids on the sheet surface. The diffusible hydrogen content in the base metal and the weld metal was quantified by thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDMS) technique. The influence of the diffusible hydrogen on the mechanical properties of the welds was determined by four-point-bend testing. The time to fracture was identified using acoustic emission technique.

The characterization of propagation paths of HIC and HAFC was carried out by OM and EBSD techniques. Mathematical and physical models for fatigue life and diffusible hydrogen concentration were established in X80 pipeline steel welded joint and results showed that the saturation concentration of diffusible hydrogen in X80 pipeline steel welded joint is refined to (19-20) x 10-6 mol/cm3, both HICs and HAFCs are preferentially propagated through fusion line of heat affect zone for the large variety in grain boundary and low KAM values. In addition, MnO inclusions introduced in welding process play an important role in turning away of HAFCs propagation direction despite of the straightforward HICs.

AB A7N01 aluminum alloy is widely used in rail transit industry due to its excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. However, due to its sensitivity to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), especially in hydrogen-containing moisture environment, the mechanical properties of hydrogen-charged A7N01 aluminum alloy friction stir welding (FSW) joints were tested through the tensile testing machine. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the tensile fracture morphology. The results indicate that the ductility and tensile strength loss of A7N01 Al alloy FSW joints are large in conditions of charging hydrogen. This is due to the embrittlement of the material caused by hydrogen infiltrating into the grain boundary of the aluminum alloy material.

AB We propose an algorithm for the solution of the problem of heat conduction and hydrogen diffusion with variable coefficients of diffusion and solubility for structurally inhomogeneous materials. As an example, we test the algorithm by solving the problem for bimetallic cylindrical specimens used, according to the ASTM G146-01 standard, for the investigation of the hydrogen resistance of bimetallic joints. We determine the distribution of hydrogen concentration in cylindrical specimens with weld overlay obtained as a result of cooling at different rates after high-temperature hydrogenation. It is shown that, in the fusion zone (on the side of the coating), we observe the formation of the zones of superequilibrium supersaturation with hydrogen, which may result in the exfoliation of the weld overlay from the base metal.

AB A numerical model of a welded joint of the hydrogen storage tank was built. The stresses caused by inner pressure, welding, and autofrettage were investigated. Numerical results showed that complicated welded residual stresses were generated in the weld central line and heat affect zone, which made the stresses in the welded joint increase and fluctuate. In order to improve the stress distribution, the autofrettage process was used after welding. Comparison of stress distribution with and without autofrettage, showed that the autofrettage process caused stresses in the welded joint of the hydrogen storage tank to be more uniform along the wall, and decreased the influence of welding on the total stresses. Therefore, the safety of a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank is improved by the application of autofrettage. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Owing to the scope of large-scale use of hydrogen energy in future technology, addressing safety issues like leakage and diffusion in all steps of production, storage, transportation, etc., will become inevitable. This paper focuses on the volume change of the combustible area after double ferrule joint leaks. First, a calibrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was built and calibrated for accuracy through a hydrogen horizontal jet process. Second, the schlieren method was used to observe the hydrogen leakage morphology when the pipe was scratched. The CFD model was used to investigate the morphology and combustible volume changes under different wind directions and speeds. Third, critical wind speed (CWS), representing the disturbance wind speed when the combustible volume generated by the hydrogen jet was reduced to 85% of the non-disturbed environment, was proposed. Fourth, the scratch leakage behavior with the double ferrule joint placed horizontally was simulated. This research found that forced convection in the hydrogen system reduced the combustible volume produced by the hydrogen jet, and the typical value of CWS here was 1.5 m/s.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Bonding the Zr-4 alloy in the high temperature can lead to many problems, for example grain coarsening and large welding deformation resulting from high residual stresses. Hydrogenation is an effective approach to decrease the bonding temperature. In the present research, the influence of hydrogen contents on the microstructure evolution and shear strength of Zr-4 alloy joints were studied. The number of interface voids markedly decreased with increasing hydrogen content at 650 degrees C. A sound joint was obtained at the hydrogen content of 0.2 wt% hydrogen. This achieved joint had a shear strength of 244 MPa, and the fracture mode of the joint presented the brittle/ductile mixed mode. With the increase of hydrogen content, the flow stress of the hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy decreased due to the decomposition of zirconium hydrides. The plasticity of the joint enhanced with increasing hydrogen content in the view of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results, and the kernel average misorientation increased from 0.11 degrees to 0.77 degrees . In addition, the diffusion behavior and diffusion coefficient of the Zr atoms were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The calculation results showed that hydrogen enhanced the diffusivity of the Zr atoms, and the diffusion coefficient of the Zr atoms accordingly increased by four orders of magnitude. The addition of hydrogen influenced the directly diffusion bonding process through two aspects: improvement of plasticity and enhancement of diffusion ability.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of E690 high-strength steel as a weld joint was investigated in artificial seawater. The most vulnerable location and microstructure to HE was verified, and the underlying mechanism was clarified. Results showed that the weld metal with granular bainitic microstructure leads to premature fracture of the entire weld joint under slow strain rate tensile testing with in-situ hydrogen charging. Dislocation slip bands (DSBs) could be preferentially developed in this zone, and HE initiation was induced via dislocation-hydrogen interaction because the weld metal had the lowest local strength among the weld joint. Martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents and carbides could also contribute to crack initiation and propagation through microvoid coalescence and decohesion.

AB This study investigates the tensile properties and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of X65 pipeline steel welded joints in hydrogen-blended natural gas environments by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT). The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility index (IPC1) of each area in the welded joint is calculated using principal component analysis, showing that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) has the highest susceptibility. The hydrogen embrittlement risk increased significantly when the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds 1.5 MPa. This phenomenon is owing to the high hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of M-A constituents and the lowest activation energy of reversible hydrogen traps in the HAZ. The hydrogen-induced performance degradation mechanism is attributed to the dislocation pinning effect that hydrogen adsorption inhibits dislocation mobility, consequently diminishing the plastic deformation capacity of material.

AB Welded joints of hydrogen-containing coal gas transmission pipelines are prone to hydrogen enrichment due to their severe microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress in them, and thus lead to the decrease of plasticity and toughness. In order to investigate the effect of local hydrogen enrichment on the safety of hydrogen-containing coal gas transport pipelines, a three dimensional numerical simulation model was established to investigate the hydrogen diffusion behaviour considering the combined effect of microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress in X80 spiral welded pipeline by using ABAQUS software. Results showed that both microstructure inhomogeneity and residual stress could lead to hydrogen diffusion. The distribution of hydrogen concentration in the pipeline was similar to that of hydrostatic stress distribution. That is, the higher the hydrostatic stress value, the higher the corresponding hydrogen concentration, indicating that the influence of residual stress on the hydrogen diffusion behaviour is greater than that of microstructure inhomogeneity. The enriched hydrogen concentration at the center region of the welded joint with the highest residual stress was 2.7 times higher than that without considering residual stress. Equivalent charging hydrogen pressure was put forward to reflect the degree of hydrogen enrichment in weld metal. Slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests were subsequently performed on weld metal specimen at equivalent charging hydrogen pressure to investigate the effect of hydrogen enrichment on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility. The SSRT tests performed in nitrogen gas and simulated coal gas were used for comparison. The HE index increased from 18.56% in simulated coal gas to 32.53% in equivalent charging hydrogen pressure, increasing by 75.27%. Therefore, the residual stress is a non-ignorable factor, because it could lead to hydrogen enrichment and could significantly influence HE susceptibility in welded joint. The determination of hydrogen enrichment in welded joint by using numerical simulation method is the basis to evaluate the safety of coal gas transmission pipeline.

AB Hydrogen and methane commonly co-exist in aquifer. Either hydrogen or methane has been individually utilized as electron donor for bio-reducing chromate. However, little is known whether microbial chromate reduction would be suppressed or promoted when both hydrogen and methane are simultaneously supplied as joint electron donors. This study for the first time demonstrated microbial chromate reduction rate could be accelerated by both hydrogen and methane donating electrons. The maximum chromate reduction rate (4.70 +/- 0.03 mg/L.d) with a volume ratio of hydrogen to methane at 1:1 was significantly higher than that with pure hydrogen (2.53 +/- 0.02 mg/L.d) or pure methane (2.01 +/- 0.02 mg/L.d) as the sole electron donor (p < 0.01). High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing detected potential chromate reducers (e.g., Spirochaetaceae, Delftia and Azonexus) and hydrogenotrophic bacteria (e.g., Acetoanaerobium) and methane-metabolizing microorganisms (e.g., Methanobacterium), indicating that these microorganisms might play important roles on microbial chromate reduction using both hydrogen and methane as electron donors. Abundant hupL and mcrA genes responsible for hydrogen oxidation and methane conversion were harbored, together with chrA gene for chromate reduction. More abundant extracellular cytochrome c and intracellular NADH were detected with joint electron donors, suggesting more active electron transfers.

AB Hydrogen induced stress corrosion cracking behavior of SUS301L-MT laser-arc hybrid welded (LAHW) joints has been investigated in our previous works. However, the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in each zone of this joint is still unclear. In this work, in combination with microstructures, cracks propagation paths and fracture surface morphologies analysis, in situ electrochemical hydrogen charging during slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests were performed on the specimens cut from base metal (BM), heat-affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM) in SUS301L-MT stainless steel LAHW joints to investigate the HE behavior of each zone. The results indicated that deformation induced martensite transformation occurred in BM and HAZ specimens during SSRT tests, resulted in cleavage morphologies on the fracture center and dimples on other areas. The fracture surface of WM specimen was all covered with dimples. During in situ hydrogen charging, the cracks in BM and HAZ specimens initiated along alpha'/gamma interface near the specimen edge. The cracks in WM specimen initiated along the delta-ferrites distributed at austenitic grain boundaries. After the cracks initiated, the hydrogen concentration distribution in combination with stress field at the front of cracks tips would induce the cracks propagation by "hydrogen enhanced local plastic deformation" and "hydrogen enhanced decohesion" mechanisms. As a result, mainly fracture characterizations of intergranular cracking, transgranular cleavage and secondary cracks formed on the fracture surface.

AB Understanding and solving the problem of hydrogen damage due to the degradation of service performance of high-strength steel caused by hydrogen penetration is a milestone for the reliability improvement of high-end hydrogen energy equipment. From the perspective of microscopic hydrogen movement behavior, this study investigated the permeability of hydrogen in base metal (BM) and welded metal (WM) of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25 V steel welded joint through electrochemical hydrogen permeation test, and the analytical models of hydrogen penetration and hydrogen diffusion in the welding zone were established, and the effect of adding hydrogen-resistant coatings (HRCs) on hydrogen movement behavior in steel substrate was studied. The results showed that the diffusivity of hydrogen in WM of the welded joint was significantly lower than that in BM, and the hydrogen concentration in BM was higher than that in WM at the beginning of hydrogenation without the addition of HRCs protection, while it tended to be consistent at the later stage. However, the hydrogen concentration in WM was lower than that in BM after adding HRCs and would be always higher than that in BM after a certain period of time, and the difference was directly related to the hydrogen resistance of the coatings. Additionally, the difference between the intermediate and outer layers for the welding zone steel substrate with and without HRCs presented a trend of rapid increase followed by a slow decrease. These findings could provide an important reference value for hydrogen damage protection measures and related researches on HRCs.

AB The coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) of conventional fusion weld joints such as submerged arc weld is particularly prone to cracking in hydrogen environments. The rotary friction welding (RFW) joint of X60 pipeline steel consists of a weld zone (WZ) and a thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). RFW process can effectively induces recrystallization, forming fine equiaxed grains with grain size consistently smaller than those in the base metal. The average grain size is 5.2 mu m in the base metal whereas it is 4.1 mu m in the HAZ, 2.3 mu m in the TMAZ and 1.6 mu m in the weld zone. The consumption of dislocations during recrystallization of the WZ and TMAZ zones reduces the number of reversible hydrogen traps in these subzones, while the increase fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in this weld joint can effectively impedes the crack propagation, collectively improving hydrogen embrittlement (HE) resistance. Slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests in a 6.3 MPa hydrogen environment showed that the RFW joint exhibits significantly higher HE resistance than the base metal. The ratio of elongation-to-failure in high-pressure hydrogen gas to that of sample tested in air is 0.97 for the RFW joint, which is considerably better than a value of 0.78 for the base metal.

AB In this study, the fatigue crack growth behavior of X65 welded joints in a natural gas mixed hydrogen environment with a total pressure of 10 MPa and hydrogen volume fractions of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% was examined. The addition of hydrogen increased the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) of X65 welded joints by more than 10 times that of nitrogen. With an increase in the hydrogen volume fraction, the fatigue crack acceleration rate gradually increased, and was proportional to the square root of the hydrogen partial pressure. The fatigue crack propagation performance and hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of the heat affected zone (HAZ) were the worst, which is related to the distribution of lath bainite (LB) with a high dislocation density and hard, brittle martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents in the HAZ. The mechanism of hydrogen-promoting fatigue crack propagation is that hydrogen promotes dislocation movement and enhances plasticity in the base metal (BM) and weld metal (WM) specimens, whereas it inhibits dislocation mobility and reduces plasticity in the HAZ specimens. Thus, the findings of this study can be expected to support the application of hydrogen transportation in natural gas pipelines.

AB The resistance of dissimilar joints to hydrogen was assessed using fracture toughness in an aggressive environment and slow strain rate tests. Six weld joint conditions were evaluated. To determine the distribution of microconstituents and elements along the interfaces, techniques such as optical and scanning electron microscopy, tomography, and nano hardness were employed. The results demonstrated that the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is directly linked to the fraction of discontinuous regions present along the dissimilar interface. Additionally, a critical evaluation of the methodology concerning the positioning of stress concentration at the dissimilar interface was carried out, and alternative approaches were presented.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement cracking caused at a weld joint is considered to be dominated by hydrogen diffusion and concentration driven by thermal stress induced by heat transfer during cooling process. The gradient of hydrostatic stress component is considered to be a driven force of hydrogen transportation. However, this problem concerns the occurrence phenomenon during cooling process. Therefore, diffusion coefficient, yield stress and Young's modulus are changed corresponding with temperature change. Especially, diffusion coefficient shows the space gradient corresponding with space gradient of temperature caused by heat transfer. This affects the diffusion equation of hydrogen as a driven force of hydrogen diffusion. Under these backgrounds, to clarify not only the effect of local thermal stress but also that of space gradient of diffusion coefficient on hydrogen release and trap, the hydrogen diffusion analysis based on our proposed alpha multiplication and FEM-FDM methods was conducted by introducing the terms of gradients of diffusion coefficient and temperature into the diffusion equation. The following results were obtained. The space gradient of diffusion coefficient was found to contribute the release of hydrogen from the site of stress concentration when the gradient of local hydrogen concentration takes the same sign as that of diffusion coefficient. Concerning the prevention of hydrogen embrittlement cracking at weld joint, these results show that not only Pre-Heat Treatment (PHT) which is a mechanical factor, but also the space gradient of diffusion coefficient which is a factor of material science was found to be one of effective factor of release of hydrogen from a site of stress concentration.

AB The unit commitment is a promising approach to guide the short-term operation of hydro-based power systems, where hydropower is the only adjustable power. However, the unit commitment is conducted individually for hydropower and hydrogen plants, primarily due to the complexities in simultaneously adjusting hydropower and hydrogen power. The joint unit commitment has seldom been derived for hybrid power systems considering hydropower and hydrogen power simultaneously. This study proposes a joint unit commitment framework that operates both hydropower and hydrogen power to adapt to large-scale photovoltaic power. First, a joint unit commitment model is developed to maximize operation benefit and minimize water consumption. After that, a strategic encoding method is proposed, effectively curtailing the dimensionality of decision variables by considering minimal operating thresholds for unit activation and deactivation. Finally, a two-layer nested approach is proposed to improve calculation efficiency. In the upper layer, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II determines the online number of hydropower and electrolyzer units. The lower layer employs a composite of dynamic programming and the cuckoo search algorithm to derive the power dispatch strategies. Results from China's Longyangxia hydro-hydrogen-photovoltaic hybrid power station indicated that the proposed approach achieved a 1.56 % reduction in water utilization and a 10.34 % enhancement in operation benefit compared with the real operation. Water consumption was 569.65 m3/s in the stochastic operation, and reduced to 567.29 m3/s in the deterministic operation. Therefore, accurate forecast is important in reducing water consumption. These results affirm the proposed joint commitment model attains a balance between water conservation and economic efficiency.

AB The effect of cathodic polarization conditions on hydrogen degradation of X2CrNiMoCuN25-6-3 super duplex stainless steel welded joints, obtained using flux cored arc and submerged arc welding methods, was evaluated. Slow strain rate tensile tests of base material and welded specimens, ferrite content measurements, scanning electron microscopy observations, and statistical analysis were performed. It was found that hydrogenation of super duplex steel welded joints under the conditions of cathodic protection in artificial seawater environment leads to hydrogen embrittlement and that the weld area shows the highest degree of degradation. Welded joints made with higher heat input and under higher current density tend to cause an increase in the degradation of mechanical properties.

AB Hydrogen production through renewable energy-powered electrolysis is pivotal for fostering a sustainable future hydrogen market. In the electricity sector, hydrogen production bears an additional demand that affects electricity price, and mathematical models are needed for the joint simulation, analysis, and planning of electricity and hydrogen sectors. This study develops a Cournot and a perfect competition model to analyze the links of the electricity and hydrogen sectors. In contrast to other solving methods approaches, the Cournot model is solved by convex reformulation techniques, substantially easing the resolution. The case studies, focusing on the Iberian Peninsula, demonstrate the region's potential for competitive hydrogen production, and the advantages of perfect competition to maximize the use of renewable energies, in contrast to Cournot's oligopoly, where the exercise of market power raises electricity prices. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of strategic decision-making in mitigating market inefficiencies, with valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers.

AB The influence of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) and fatigue damage on the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of X80 steel welded joints, obtained using flux-cored arc welding method, was investigated in the study. Compared to the as-welded specimens, the sensitivity of hydrogen embrittlement after PWHT was decreased. However, the coupling effect of PWHT and fatigue damage improved significantly the HE sensitivity. Furthermore, the fracture site of the PWHT + pre-fatigue specimens with hydrogen-charged was transferred to the weld metal, and the fracture was characterized by intergranular fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) and shallow dimples ductile fracture. The increase of the hydrogen content might be attributed to the evolutions of dislocation and the proportion of high-angle grain boundary caused by fatigue damage. Meanwhile, the size of QC for the hydrogencharged welded joints was related to the degree of fatigue damage, hydrogen content and microstructure strength.

AB Laser-arc hybrid welding (LAHW) process has been applied for excellent manufacturing the new generation subway vehicles underframe using cold rolled SUS301 L stainless steel. However, the effects of hydrogen atoms on the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior are still unclear, which is probably a latent risk for the application. Here, in combination with the microstructures and fracture morphologies analysis, the effects of hydrogen atoms on SCC behavior of SUS301L-MT (MT = 15% cold rolling, middle tensile) stainless steel LAHW welded joints and the base metal (BM) was investigated by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method during applied cathode potentials on the specimen in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The results indicated that the SUS301L-MT ASS LAHW welded joints exhibited lower SCC susceptibility than that of BM, particularly at very negative cathode potential, -1200 mV and -1400 mV, the SCC susceptibility of the welded joints (similar to 0.3) is 2 times lower than that of BM (similar to 0.6), due to the high solubility of hydrogen atoms and low hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of weld metal (WM). We hope this study can help to assist LAHW process widely apply for the manufacturing of new generation subway vehicles underframe as well as other welding structures.

AB Welded joints suffer from hydrogen embrittlement (HE) owing to the internal stress generated during welding. Alloying elements play a vital role in the metallurgical behavior of welded joints. In this study, the influence of chromium (Cr) and titanium (Ti) on the HE behavior of welded joints in low -alloy steel was investigated by examining the microstructural morphology, grain characteristics, precipitate particles, engineering stress-strain curves, and fracture modes. The experimental results indicated that, compared with the addition of Cr, the addition of Ti promoted the formation of acicular ferrite in the lower fusion zone (FZ) via Ti -bearing oxides, and refined the grains of the FZ. The strength and elongation of the Ti joint were superior to those of the Cr joint in both air- and hydrogen -containing environments. Furthermore, compared with the addition of Cr, the addition of Ti improved the HE sensitivity. The fracture modes of both the Cr and Ti welded joints changed from ductile to brittle when the prepared joints were exposed to an H -containing environment.

AB Recently, there has been a surge in interest globally for offshore wind-powered hydrogen production (OWPHP) as a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach. To cut the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of the decentralized OWPHP, we propose a joint optimization model that simultaneously optimizes the wind farm layout and electrolyzer capacity, accounting for the wake effect among turbines. Further, to address the computational complexities, a bi-level distributed decomposition method (BLDDM) is developed, which could decompose the primary problem into several subproblems in a hierarchical and distributed manner, allowing the efficient solution with alternating direction method of multipliers. Case studies are conducted based on actual data to validate the effectiveness of the model, demonstrating that the joint optimization approach would significantly reduce the LCOH compared to the individual approach. Meanwhile, the proposed BLDDM has a better computational performance than the commonly used nonlinear optimization algorithms.

AB In this study, fracture behaviors of base metal and weld metal of ferritic steel welded joint in the thick wall pipeline for hydrogen transportation were investigated and the effects of hydrogen and specimen thickness (B) on fracture toughness were comprehensively considered in detail. A series of single edge notched tensile (SENT) tests for base metal and weld metal with B/W (width) ratio of 0.5, 1 and 2 were conducted with and without preelectrochemical hydrogen charging, and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) of Sm value was obtained by the double clip gauges method. It was found that fracture toughness (Sm) of base metal and weld metal decreased with increasing specimen thickness or hydrogenating, and Sm of hydrogenating specimen with B/W ratio of 2 was smallest. It was believed that large specimen thickness decreased fracture toughness by constraining plastic deformation at crack tip and restricting dislocations movement, while hydrogen promoted embrittlement by reducing cohesive energy of fracture. In the hydrogenating specimen with larger thickness, there was lower dislocation density near crack tip, leading to a decrease in trapped hydrogen and intensifying the cohesive energy reduction effect, which resulted in reduced Sm and the worse fracture toughness, and it means that hydrogen and specimen thickness synergistically affected fracture toughness. In addition, effect of thickness and hydrogen on decreasing fracture toughness was more pronounced for weld metal than base metal, which could be attributed to poorer plastic deformation ability of weld metal and lower dislocation density at crack tip. It is concluded that the hydrogen and thickness effects should be taken into account for the structural integrity evaluation of welded joint in hydrogen transportation pipeline.

AB In this work, elastic-plastic fracture toughness tests were conducted on X80 base metal (BM), weld metal (WM), and heat affected zone (HAZ) under 12 MPa total pressure with 10 vol% and 30 vol% hydrogen-blended environments. Experimental results revealed that as the hydrogen blending ratio increased from 10 vol% to 30 vol%, the hydrogen-induced fracture toughness KIH values of the BM, WM, and HAZ decreased by 14.6 %, 17.3 %, and 21.4 %, respectively. Within the investigated parameter range, both WM and HAZ exhibited higher hydrogen-induced crack propagation resistance than the BM under identical environments. Based on experimental results, a finite element framework was established to analyze cross-region fatigue crack growth in welded joints under residual stress. Numerical simulations revealed that in 30 vol% hydrogen environments coupled with welding residual stress, the equivalent stress intensity factor Keq at the crack tip in the weld zone exceeds the KIH at 45 % of the wall thickness, posing a fracture risk to the welded joint. Moreover, post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) significantly improves the stress state of welded joints. When the PWHT temperature exceeds 500 degrees C, fatigue cracks maintain stable propagation until reaching 80 % of the wall thickness, with Keq consistently remaining below KIH throughout the crack growth process.

AB Weld joints can experience numerous defects, which may become enriched in hydrogen and form pits after an attack. However, few in situ studies have been conducted on the relationship between hydrogen enrichment and pitting initiation sites. Moreover, the mechanism by which hydrogen enrichment pro-motes the initiation and propagation of pitting is unknown. In this study, the pitting susceptibility of austenitic stainless steel weld joints that had been used for 6 years in a hydrocracking unit was investi-gated. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) was performed to characterize the Volta potential before and after hydrogen removal. The alpha/gamma phase boundaries of the as-received samples were mostly enriched in hydrogen. Furthermore, the alpha/gamma phase boundaries were the preferential locations for the initiation and propagation of pits, which were located at sites of hydrogen enrichment. The results of focused ion beam analysis revealed that the pits deepened along the alpha/gamma phase boundaries and achieved stability. Hydrogen enrichment promotes the transformation of metastable pits to stable pits, which may be the mechanism underlying the promotion of pitting propagation by hydrogen enrichment.

AB The effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of X70 welded joint was investigated in simulated natural gas/hydrogen mixtures at 10 MPa. The hydrogen volume fraction was set as 0, 5.0 and 10.0 vol.%. The slow strain rate tensile test showed that the reduction in the area of the welded zone (WZ) metal was reduced more than that of the base metal. The variation in fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) from high to low followed the order: heat-affected zone (HAZ) metal, base metal and WZ metal. In addition, the difference became more obvious with increasing hydrogen volume fraction. For the HAZ metal, the FCGR in 10.0 vol.% hydrogen mixtures was approximately 22 times of that in nitrogen. Furthermore, based on FCGR and fracture mechanics, the predicted fatigue life of the X70 pipeline with an initial flaw depth of 0.5 mm dropped sharply from 34,302 cycles to 3457 cycles even though 5.0 vol.% hydrogen was added in the simulated natural gas.

AB The transition to the zero-carbon power system is underway accelerating recently. Hydrogen energy and electric vehicles (EVs) are promising solutions on the supply and demand sides. This brief presents a novel architecture that includes hydrogen production stations, fast-charging stations, and commercial EVs. The proposed architecture jointly optimizes the hydrogen energy dispatch and the EV charging location selection and is formulated by a time-varying bilevel bipartite graph (T-BBG) model. We develop a bilevel iteration optimization method combining the linear programming (LP) and the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm to solve the joint problem whose optimality is proved theoretically. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture on reducing the operating cost is verified via case studies in Shanghai. The proposed method outperforms other strategies and improves the performance by at least 13%, which shows the potential economic benefits of the joint architecture. The convergence and impact of parameters are assessed.

AB This study investigated the hydrogen embrittlement behaviors of three laser welding joints for the 1500 MPa AlSi coated steel using slow strain rate tensile and hydrogen concentration experiments. The results show that LWHT is fractured in the fusion zone without hydrogen charging because the S-ferrite reduces the mechanical properties. With the increase in hydrogen concentration, the fracture location is still FZ. The fusion zone of LWFHT is composed of martensite and retained austenite, and when the hydrogen concentration is 3.4 ppm, retained austenite traps many hydrogen atoms. The newly formed martensite during tensile inheriting the high hydrogen concentration in retained austenite causes cleavage in the fusion zone. When the hydrogen concentration is 13.6 ppm, most hydrogen segregates at the prior austenite grain boundaries, causing an intergranular fracture in the fusion zone. The fusion zone of LWF-HS is composed of martensite and carbide, and grain refinement and nanoscaled Fe3C can reduce HE susceptibility. With the increase in hydrogen concentration, the fracture location is still base materials. The significantly increased hydrogen concentration compared to LWF-HT is mainly trapped in carbides without reducing the banding force of dislocations and grain boundaries. This work provides a scientific basis and technical direction for realizing high-quality laser wire-filling welding of Al-Si coated steel.

AB The effects of the organizational characteristics and morphological distribution of Ti-6Al-4V alloy welded joint on their resistance to hydrogen embrittlement were investigated. The beta-phase continuity of the base material (BM) was poor, and the large volume of the striped alpha-phase hindered hydrogen diffusion. Consequently, the BM has low hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity. The basket-like phase distribution of the weld material (WM) had better beta-phase continuity and higher phase boundary density compared with the BM, providing a more convenient channel for hydrogen diffusion and more hydrogen absorption sites. Therefore, the WM had a high hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity.

AB Welds of thick plates (304 SS) clad with Ti of commercial purity in as-received state and also after subsequent heat treatment and/or after hydrogen charging were investigated. Fatigue tests were carried out at amplitude of 20 Hz and in case of bimetal without hydrogen charging also at amplitude of 40 Hz. After heat treatment, charged welds showed higher threshold level than the welds without heat treatment. Energy dispersed analyses (EDA) of fracture surfaces showed that failure predominantly occurred in joint. Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) response of bimetal samples demonstrated favourable results both after welding and after subsequent heat treatment. Short and thin cracks were observed, exclusively located in mixed zone, where approx. 16-20 at. % of Ti using EDX (energy dispersed analyser) was revealed. By application of monochromatic synchrotron radiation Ti-alpha, Fe-fcc, Fe-bcc and intermetallic phase Fe2Ti were detected.

AB Recent work on the resource potential of natural hydrogen indicates that it holds great promise as an important component in the energy portfolio by 2050. However, effective exploration strategies for natural hydrogen are yet to be developed. In this study, we developed a workflow to identify prospective areas for natural hydrogen exploration by targeting the serpentinites (serpentinized ophiolite formations) based on their distinct gravity and magnetic signatures resulting from serpentinization, a key geological process responsible for subsurface natural hydrogen generation. Utilizing gravity and aeromagnetic data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field (CLVF) in northern California, we performed three-dimensional (3D) joint inversion and applied geological differentiation techniques to classify and interpret subsurface geological units. By integrating geophysical measurements, surface geological information, and geothermal well measurements, we identified multiple prospective targets within CLVF and estimated the natural hydrogen generation potential. Our work provides a cost-effective approach for natural hydrogen exploration, offering valuable guidance for further investigation and preliminary drilling.

AB The effect of hydrogen charging on the electrochemical behavior, surface properties, and the cracking processes of Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo (Ti80) alloy base metal and welded joint is investigated. Hydrogen promotes the deterioration of the Ti80 including the destruction of the passive film, formation of the hydrides, initiation of the cracks, and decrease of the mechanical properties. The weld metal show much higher susceptibility to hydrogen because of the finer grains with lamellar structure. Hydrogen embrittlement mechanism differs from the hydrogen introducing approach. The hydrides, internal hydrogen, and hydrogen-stress interaction play different roles in the hydrogen damage process of the Ti80 alloy.

AB The cylinder sections in a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank are usually connected by girth welded joints. However, due to the ultra-thick wall of the cylinder, the weld geometry has a significant influence on the residual stress distributions, which are very difficult to be fully determined by experimental methods. Therefore, in this paper, four sequential coupling two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric finite element (FE) models with different weld geometries have been developed to study the effects of weld groove shape on the residual stresses. In addition, the effects of working pressure (75 MPa) on the welding residual stress distributions have been investigated. The results demonstrate that different weld groove shapes bring different residual stress distributions, leading to different influences on structural integrity. Among the four types of welded joints, V and U types have similar residual stress distributions, and X and d-U types have similar distributions, but the latter two types have large tensile residual stresses at their inner surfaces, which have a greater risk of generating hydrogen induced cracking (HIC). After introducing a working pressure of 75 MPa, the welding residual stresses are redistributed, and the weld regions of the four types of welded joints are all fully yielded and plasticized. Based on the residual stress considerations, using V-shape groove can obtain the best residual stress distributions in an ultra-thick girth welded joint, which provides a reference for the welding and fabrication of a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank.

AB The effect of heat treatment condition and diffusible hydrogen level on microstructure and mechanical properties of multi-pass shielded metal arc welded (SMAW) P91 steel butt joints of 18 mm thickness has been studied. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Mercury diffusible hydrogen measurement, Charpy test, room-temperature tensile testing, hardness measurement and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to characterize the multi-pass SMAW joints in as-welded, post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) and normalizing/tempering (N&T) state. The P91 steel butt joints with low level of diffusible hydrogen exhibited higher tensile strength and toughness. Both PWHT and N&T treatment provided similar mechanical properties but a significant microstructure variation was noticed for different zones of P91 welds. N&T treatment produced the homogenize microstructure along the P91 weldments both in terms of microstructure and micro-hardness. (C) 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

AB Green hydrogen is an attractive option for energy carrier, which can counteract the intermittent nature of renewable electricity production. While the synergy between renewable energy system and hydrogen system in this sense is obvious, its detailed analysis has only recently received attention. In this work, the advantages of joint planning (i.e., simultaneous planning of both energy and hydrogen systems) are analyzed in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this work, a mixed-integer linear programming problem is proposed to this end to make optimal decisions for the combined system of green hydrogen and renewable energy, which we call an integrated supply chain of hydrogen and renewable energy (ISCHRE) system. The objective of such problem is to determine 1) the location and capacity of production, storage, and transportation & transmission facilities, and 2) the hourly operational decisions throughout the year to satisfy both green hydrogen and energy demands, while minimizing the total annualized cost of the entire system. Using the proposed model, the optimal ISCHRE system for South Korea is designed with the target of 10 % penetration of both nationwide hydrogen and electricity production. The national territory of South Korea is divided into five regions, and the decisions within each region and inter-region decisions are extensively analyzed. It was shown that, through joint planning, a significant cost saving can be achieved, showing a 20.8 % reduction in the total annualized cost. Also, despite the reduced renewable production, both hydrogen and energy demands were met through extensive bidirectional electricity transmission, which also decentralized green hydrogen production.

AB The effects of hydrogen addition (0.12 wt% H) on microstructural evolution in Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints have been investigated using optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal the influence of hydrogen on the characteristics of defect-free titanium alloy welded joints. The results show that hydride precipitation changes the initial microstructure of the welded joints. The increase of hydrogen content is favorable for the beta phase precipitation. Face centered cubic delta hydride is evenly distributed in the hydrogenated 0.12 wt% H welded joints. The lamellar delta hydride could only precipitate from the lamellae alpha, and not from the transformed beta phase. Formation of delta hydride is associated with the result of alpha(H) phase separation reaction: alpha(H)->alpha (H lean region) + delta (H rich region), and H rich regions finally transform to the delta phase. The dislocation distribution is heterogeneous and there is a relatively high density of dislocations in the vicinity of the precipitated delta hydride, which are caused by the lattice distortion due to the stress field generated by the hydride precipitation.

AB Ultrafine powders are crucial for the preparation of high-performance Re-based materials via low-temperature sintering. In this work, a joint reduction method of carbon and hydrogen is proposed to prepare Re nanopowder for the first time. The former carbon black can significantly reduce the particle size of final products, and the latter hydrogen reduction can decrease the contents of carbon and oxygen residues. And the as-obtained rhenium nanopowder is only about 108.6 nm with a slight carbon (0.019 wt%) and oxygen (0.03 wt%). This method is straightforward, easy to implement, low-cost and conducive to the large-scale industrial production.

AB This paper investigates the stress corrosion cracking behavior of 2205 duplex stainless steel welded joints under the coupling of hydrogen, corrosive medium and stress. The results show that the presence of hydrogen shifts the fracture location from the base material to the heat affected zone. Cracks initiated at the pitting sites, and the locations of the pitting sites were highly consistent with the stress corrosion cracking locations. This suggests that hydrogen causes the heat affected zone to initiate pitting and further initiates crack initiation and stress corrosion fracture.

AB This paper investigated the effects of welding and alternating wet-dry seawater on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of a new nanoparticle-reinforced high-strength steel, dispersion-strengthened-high-strength (DSHS) steel. The results show that welding led to the transformation of granular bainite to tempered martensite. It also promotes grain coarsening as well as an increase in inclusions size and irregular changes in shape. This results in increased susceptibility to HE at the welded joint (WJ). After wet-dry cycle corrosion in seawater, corrosion products impede the oxygen transfer and promote the hydrogen evolution reaction, so the hydrogen production increases. The decrease in the protection of corrosion products at the WJ and the decrease in NbC content led to an increase in hydrogen production but a decrease in hydrogen trapping capacity. Therefore, the WJ HE sensitivity of DSHS steel is further increased. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphynes are potential hydrogen storage materials due to their unique acetylene bond structure (C-C = C-C), and can be classified into alpha-GY, ss-GY, gamma-GY, sigma-GY, GDY, etc., according to the proportion of their involved acetylene bonds. To enhance their hydrogen storage capacities, four typical graphynes (alpha-GY, ss-GY, delta-GY, and GDY) were modified by a joint Na-decoration and B-doping technique in this research, and the hydrogen adsorption processes of these modified graphynes were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation to clarify the effects of the structure modification on their hydrogen storage capacities. The results showed that the hydrogen storage capacities of the modified graphynes are larger than those of non-modified graphynes, and that the joint Na-decorated and B-doped alpha-GY obtains the largest hydrogen storage capacity of 9.41 wt%. The mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen storage by the joint Na-decoration and B-doping was found to be that the Na-decoration and B-doping strengthen the adsorption energy between acetylene bonds and hydrogen atoms. Since the modified alpha-GY has satisfactory hydrogen storage capacity, far exceeding the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 for portable hydrogen storage system, it can be expected to be a potential hydrogen storage material in the future.

AB As the need for duplex stainless steel (DSS) increases, it is necessary to evaluate hydrogen stress cracking (HSC) in dissimilar welded joints (WJs) of DSS and carbon steel. This study aims to investigate the effect of the weld microstructure on the HSC behaviour of dissimilar gas-tungsten arc welds of DSS and carbon steel. In situ slow-strain rate testing (SSRT) with hydrogen charging was conducted for transverse WJs, which fractured in the softened heat-affected zone of the carbon steel under hydrogen-free conditions. However, HSC occurred at the martensite band and the interface of the austenite and martensite bands in the type-II boundary. The band acted as an HSC initiation site because of the presence of a large amount of trapped hydrogen and a high strain concentration during the SSRT with hydrogen charging. Even though some weld microstructures such as the austenite and martensite bands in type-II boundaries were harmless under normal hydrogen-free conditions, they had a negative effect in a hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the premature rupture of the weld. Eventually, a premature fracture occurred during the in situ SSRT in the type-II boundary because of the hydrogen-enhanced strain-induced void (HESIV) and hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) mechanisms.

AB The effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of 304L keyhole tungsten inert gas welded joint were investigated in the study. The presence of hydrogen resulted in a significant decrease in the macroscopic ductility of the weld metal, and fracture may be initiated at the sites of clustered dislocations due to hydrogen atoms. Moreover, it is found that hydrogen may result in more severe loss in ductility and noticeable decrease in the flow stress and strength of the base metal, because of the interplay between the hydrogen atoms and strain-induced alpha' martensite. Strain-induced alpha' martensitic transformation and phase boundaries in the base metal may provide more sites for the accumulation of hydrogen and dislocations, leading to an appreciable decrease in the ductility and strength of the base metal.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility and influence mechanism of X80 weld joints. Slow strain rate testing (SSRT) under in situ H-charging, combined with microstructure and fracture analysis, was performed on the base metal (BM), weld metal (WM), thermally simulated fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). Results showed that the WM and simulated HAZ had a greater degree of high local strain distribution than the BM; compared to the CGHAZ, the FGHAZ had lower microhardness and more uniformly distributed stress. SSRT results showed that the weld joint was highly sensitive to HE; the HE index decreased in the following sequence: FGHAZ, WM, CGHAZ and BM. The effect of the microstructure on HE was mainly reflected in microstructure, local stress distribution and microhardness.

AB Although hot wire TIG welding improves the speed of deposition compared to TIG welding, it still falls short compared to submerged arc welding. However, adding hydrogen to the protective atmosphere of hot wire TIG welding can further enhance the cladding efficiency. Nevertheless, hydrogen can also deteriorate joint performance and cause defects such as hydrogen cracks. In this study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen on the properties and low-temperature toughness of 9Ni steel joints welded by TIP-TIG for LNG storage tanks. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and a universal testing machine. The results showed that the TT weld hydrogenated in a protective atmosphere exhibited good strength and low-temperature toughness. The optimal proportion of mixed gas was found to be 98% Ar + 2% H2. At 2% hydrogen content, the width of the weld dendrite and the grain size of the coarse grain region were relatively small, and the fracture surface displayed large and deep dimpling and high cleavage step, resulting in the highest low-temperature toughness. However, when the hydrogen content increased to 8%, micropores were generated in the weld, disrupting the material's continuity and reducing the low-temperature impact energy absorption of the weld, thereby damaging the low-temperature toughness of the molten metal.

AB Hydrogen energy is critical in replacing fossil fuels and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Three measures can be implemented to promote hydrogen energy: reduce the cost of low-carbon hydrogen through technological improvements, increase the production capacity of low-carbon hydrogen by stimulating investment, and enhance hydrogen use as an energy carrier and in industrial processes by demand-side policies. This article examines how effective these measures are, if successfully implemented, in boosting the hydrogen market and reducing global economy-wide carbon emissions using a global computable general equilibrium model. The results show that all the measures increase the production and use of low-carbon hydrogen, whether implemented alone or jointly. Notably, the emissions reduced by joint implementation of all the measures in 2050 become 2.5 times the sum of emissions reduced by individual implementation, indicating a considerable multiplier effect. This suggests supply and demand side policies be implemented jointly to maximize their impact on reducing emissions.

AB The effect of hydrogen in a 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25 V steel welded joint was studied using tensile mechanical and hydrogen permeation tests. Hydrogen diffusivity and solubility were determined by electrochemical (room temperature) and gas permeation (350-500 degrees C) tests. The hydrogen permeation curve for the base metal, at room temperature exhibited a strong deviation of sigmoidal shape indicating the influence of deep traps as martensite and austenite phases. The hydrogen solubility at room temperature obtained for the base material was equal to 21.8 molH m(-3). At high temperatures (350-500 degrees C) the apparent hydrogen diffusivity was: D = 1.3.10(-6) exp (-3 2.2 4kJ/mol /RT)m(2) S-1 for the base metal and D = 2.0.10(-7)exp (-27,3+/-3kJ/mol/RT)m(2) s(-1) for the weld metal. Stress strain tests revealed that in the hydrogenated samples, applying elastic stress, there was increase of hydrogen embrittlement of this alloy due to the enhancement of hydrogen solubility.

AB Stress relaxation plays a key role in ceramic/metal joints, and reliable information is crucial for developing multilayer composite fillers and reaching promising joint strengths. There are currently limited relevant experimental studies due to the difficulty in detection. Taking the Al2O3/stainless steel joint as an example, the study gives a new method to unveil the role of elastic-plasticity of sandwich composites in stress relaxation. By using the thermo-hydrogen treatment technology, the joint strength was almost only affected by the thermal mismatch at a fixed brazing parameter, which can be an indirect indicator of stress relaxation. In the meantime, it is a promising method for stress relief. It was found that the joint strength, which corresponds to the residual stress relaxation, was promoted by the presence of hydrogen, which corresponds to the elastoplastic properties of the fillers. This dependency was amplified in the harder/softer/harder structure. Finite element analysis verified the experiment results by calculating the stress concentration, strain energy density, equivalent moment, and shear forces at stress-concentrated regions because the more ductile interlayer had higher strain but lower stress, and easier plastic deformation during the brazing process. The occurrence of dislocation movement, grain boundary slip, stacking fault, and dynamic crystallization played a significant role in the plastic deformation.

AB Fabrication of a bimetallic joint to facilitate a material transition from a 6061-T651 aluminum pressure vessel liner to stainless steel tubing in cryogenic pressure vessels is explored using three different dissimilar metal interlayers with an explosive welding (EXW) process. Due to difficulties in directly EXW joining aluminum (Al) 6061 to 304 stainless steel, interlayers are used to prevent interaction of the aluminum and stainless steel, thus minimizing brittle intermetallic phase formation. Titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), and tantalum (Ta) were selected as the dissimilar metal interlayer materials; each having advantages and disadvantages. Titanium is a commonly used interlayer for this joint, but can microcrack during EXW if the bonding parameters are not correct. Copper has the advantage that it is compatible with hydrogen, but is also known to form brittle intermetallics with aluminum. Tantalum is ductile and bonds well to both Al and stainless steel, and is a high temperature metal that does well to prevent interdiffusion and intermetallic phase formation. However Ta is the most expensive metal of the three. Results of the characterization of the three interlayer bonds showed that Ti produced the highest strength joints, Ta produced the most ductile joints, and Cu produced a joint that failed with low ductility at the Al/Cu interface. Based on these results, the Cu-interlayer joint is not recommended for this application, while the Ti and Ta interlayer bonds both appear to have sufficient strength and ductility for the intended use.

AB In order to investigate stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of X65 pipeline steel and its welded joint area in deep sea environment. The simulated methods were used to obtain the welded joint of hardening and softening tissue in heat affected zone (HAZ) by annealing at 1300 degrees C for 10 min and then, normalized in air and quenched in water respectively; the other was to get 1000 m depths of marine environment. The effect of hydrogen on SCC behavior of X65 pipeline steel in simulated deep sea environment was analyzed by a combination of hydrogen-charging, slow stain rate test (SSRT), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemistry. Results demonstrated that with the increasing of charging current density, Fracture of as-received appeared brittle characteristics and normalized and quenched steel generated micro cracks, Hydrogen-charging will enhance the SCC susceptibility of the steel in simulated deep sea environment. The corrosion potential of X65 steels was low in deep sea environment with hydrogen evolution reaction and showed some SCC sensitivity in deep sea environment. Heat treatment altered the microstructure of the steel, resulting in a change of SCC susceptibility. In particular, the quenched steel with a bainite micro-structure which had a higher SCC susceptibility than as-received and normalized steel in deep sea environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Currently, the proportion of distributed renewable energy sources in distribution networks is continuously increasing, while electric vehicles (pure electric and hydrogen-powered) are experiencing substantial growth within the transportation network. Addressing how to coordinate the regulation of renewable power generation and guide electric vehicle charging, thereby ensuring secure distribution network operations and enhancing traffic network efficiency, has become an urgent issue. This paper proposes a novel strategy for coordinated regulating the coupled system through adjusting hydrogen flow via a joint electricity price-hydrogen price- charging price mechanism. Electricity prices serve to control the electrical energy flow; hydrogen prices control the hydrogen energy flow; and charging prices control the charging patterns of electric vehicles. Two pricing mechanisms are compared: one considering only electricity prices and charging prices (without hydrogen energy flow), and another incorporating electricity prices, hydrogen prices, and charging prices (with hydrogen energy flow). Based on these pricing mechanisms, two methods are contrasted: a rule-based price updating approach and a reinforcement learning-based DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) price decision method. Results show that in the proposed price mechanism (with hydrogen energy flow) DDPG strategy, the voltage deviation has decreased by 0.007 (p.u.) compared to the old price mechanism (without hydrogen energy flow) rule-based strategy. However, there is no significant improvement observed in terms of transportation network regulation capability, in the proposed price mechanism DDPG strategy, the waiting time and time loss have increased by 2.2% and 1.2% compared to the old price mechanism rule-based strategy. Results reveal that the proposed joint electricity price-hydrogen price-charging price mechanism exhibits superior performance, which can effectively control the electrical energy flow-hydrogen energy flow-traffic flow. However different coupling devices exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to price changes. In addition, the DDPG method proves more effective. In future research, the main focus is on addressing the insufficient explainability of deep reinforcement learning.

ID OPERATION
AB Due to the significantly differentiated electrolytic hydrogen capacity caused by resource characteristics such as wind, solar, hydro, and thermal power in different regions of China, region joint electrolytic hydrogen systems (RJEHS) considering multiple energy sources is proposed to improve this situation. In this framework, a regional decoupling model is established for typical cascade hydropower in Southwest China to simulate the actual operation of it. Moreover, the advantages of RJEHS compared with region separate electrolytic hydrogen systems (RSEHS) in reducing levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), carbon emission and the installed capacity of renewable energy power generation are also studied. In addition, differential models considering the power and ramping characteristics of three different types of electrolyzers are established. And the evolution process and development prospect of the planned configuration of the three types of electrolyzers during 2025--2050 are given. The case study verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB The modified 9Cr-1Mo-V steel commercially designated as P91 steel have major application in thermal and nuclear power plants for its capability of working in optimum temperature and gas pressure region. A careful joining or welding process of P91 steel is required during its application in thermal and nuclear power plants to avoid different limitation such as evolution of delta ferrite in the fusion zone and its susceptibility to type IV cracking as well as Hydrogen Assisted Cracking (HAC). HAC poses a significant challenge in P91 steel welded joint owing to the undesired formation of martensitic metallurgical transformations during welding process. This present study investigates the impact of different induction assisted heat treatment conditions on HAC of P91 welded joint. The susceptibility of HAC was evaluated through implant test, amount of diffusible hydrogen in the weld metal and numerically estimated tensile residual stress. Implant test results were analyzed to find out lower critical stress and Critical Stress Ratio. The microstructure of the coarse grain heat affected zone and weld metal under various conditions was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, a correlation was established between different induction assisted heat treatment condition with diffusible hydrogen content and tensile residual stress for assess the hydrogen assisted cracking susceptibility. The findings clearly indicate that P91 steel welded joint without any pre/post heating is more susceptible to HAC. However, implementation of induction assisted preheating and post heating effectively reduced the amount of diffusible hydrogen, tensile residual stress and lowers down the susceptibility of HAC. The results suggested that induction assisted GMAW followed by induction post heating could be recommended for the welding of P91 steel.

AB In addition to the well-known case of spherical coordinates, the Schrodinger equation of the hydrogen atom separates in three further coordinate systems. Separating in a particular coordinate system defines a system of three commuting operators. We show that the joint spectrum of the Hamilton operator, the z component of the angular momentum, and an operator involving the z component of the quantum LaplaceRunge- Lenz vector obtained from separation in prolate spheroidal coordinates has quantum monodromy for energies sufficiently close to the ionization threshold. The precise value of the energy above which monodromy is observed depends on the distance of the focus points of the spheroidal coordinates. The presence of monodromy means that one cannot globally assign quantum numbers to the joint spectrum. Whereas the principal quantum number n and the magnetic quantum number m correspond to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of globally defined classical actions a third quantum number cannot be globally defined because the third action is globally multivalued.

AB A single-pass laser welding process was conducted on a 20 mm thick X80 pipeline steel plate utilizing a 30 kW ultra-high-power fiber laser. The study investigated the effects of various welding process parameters on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of the welded joints. The electrochemical method was employed to assess the hydrogen absorption capacity of both X80 pipeline steel and its welds under electrochemical hydrogen charging conditions. Additionally, the corrosion behavior of X80 steel and its welds in a 3.5% NaCl solution following electrochemical hydrogen charging was examined by x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the microstructure of weld zone primarily consists of ferrite and bainite. The hardness value in this region decreases progressively with increasing laser power, exhibiting the highest hardness at the bottom section along the thickness direction. Additionally, tensile strength diminishes as laser power increases, with peak values observed in the middle section of the thickness direction. Notably, the mechanical properties of these joints are significantly enhanced compared to those of the base metal. In terms of corrosion resistance, welds demonstrate slightly inferior performance relative to that of the base metal; furthermore, their corrosion resistance declines with rising laser power. Both diffusible hydrogen concentrations in the base metal and welds exhibit a similar upward trend as hydrogen charging time extends. A saturation level for diffusible hydrogen concentration is reached after 12 h of charging. Under identical hydrogen charging conditions, larger grain sizes and an increased number of hydrogen traps within the weld render it more susceptible to hydrogen absorption than its base metal counterpart. In terms of the impact of hydrogen on corrosion behavior, an increase in both the hydrogen charging current density and the duration of hydrogen charging exacerbates the corrosion characteristics of both the base metal and weld. Furthermore, it is observed that the corrosion resistance exhibits minimal variation with prolonged hydrogen charging time. Moreover, under equivalent conditions, electrochemical responses reveal that welds are less affected by hydrogen charging compared to base metals; thus indicating superior corrosion resistance for welds over their corresponding base metals. The corrosion products observed before and after hydrogen charging are primarily composed of alpha-FeOOH, alpha-Fe2O3, and gamma-FeOOH. Following hydrogen charging, the welds exhibit a relatively higher content of alpha-FeOOH, which serves to impede matrix corrosion to some extent.

AB Pitting corrosion of austenitic stainless steel weld joints served in a hydrocracking unit for 6 years was examined. The microstructure of weld metal (WM) and fusion line (FL) was austenite and ferrite. After the immersion test, many pits were observed on the FL, whereas few pits were observed on the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Pits were microscopically initiated at ferrite/austenite boundaries. Hydrogen concentrations at FL and WM were higher than those of HAZ, and hydrogen segregation occurred at ferrite/austenite boundaries, which was consistent with the pit position. Hydrogen enrichment conditions varied under different microstructures, which induced the difference in pitting susceptibility.

AB Heavy metal ions and micro(nano)plastic pollution have attracted increasing attention. However, their toxicological effects on endogenous reactive species at molecular level are unclear, especially their joint effects. Hence, two typical environmental poisons, mercury (Hg-2(+)) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), posing significant risks to both human health and ecosystems, are selected as pollution models for studying joint effects. Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn, n > 1) play crucial roles in removing oxidants and intracellular electrophilic reagents, involved in regulating intracellular redox state. The understanding of its precise biological role and intricate mechanism action remains limited, especially suffering from exogenous environmental stress. Herein, we have developed a novel H2Sn- responsive fluorescence probe P-Y with outstanding performance. Moreover, probe P-Y could image endogenous H2Sn levels in cells, and was successfully applied for monitoring the fluctuations of endogenous H2Sn levels to investigate their effects on redox homeostasis under Hg2+ and PMMA single and combined exposure. This study provided imaging evidences and an absorbing insight for understanding H2Sn function under Hg2+ and PMMA single and joint effects in living organisms.

ID POWER; STORAGE
AB In view of the rough modeling of hydrogen energy system, insufficient analysis of hydrogen energy utilization mode, and the lack of consideration of the multiple uncertain factors, this paper proposes a joint optimization method of planning and operation for integrated electrothermal and hydrogen coupling system (IEHS) based on multiverse optimizer algorithm (MVO) and interval linear programming method. Firstly, the frame structure of IEHS is constructed, and multiple utilization modes of hydrogen energy are analyzed. Secondly, considering the hydrogen physical characteristics, the operation model of high-pressure hydrogen storage device based on Van Deemter equation is established, and the linear model of compressor power consumption is built considering dynamic compression ratio. On this basis, the bilevel optimization model of planning and operation for IEHS is established considering multiuncertainty and multiple hydrogen energy utilization modes. The upper model realizes the capacity configuration of equipment with the goal of minimizing the total construction and operation cost within the service life. The lower model optimizes the output of each equipment with the goal of minimizing the operation cost. The example results show that MVO and interval linear programming method for solving the bilevel optimization model have the better convergence speed and convergence ability. Further, the multiple utilization modes of hydrogen energy can effectively reduce the construction and operation cost of IEHS, and accurately depicting the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage system can increase the coordination and optimization ability of IEHS. Considering multiple uncertain factors, the optimal configuration scheme and operation cost of IEHS are more stable.

AB This paper discusses the effect of different combinations of preheating and post-heating on the corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement of Grade-91 steel weld joint in the as-welded condition. Though these welds are subjected to post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), there could be long delay in executing this, especially in the case of fabrication of large components, and during this delay, the welds in as-welded conditions are prone to environmental degradations like hydrogen embrittlement and different forms of corrosion. Though recommended minimum preheating and post-heating conditions are already known for welding of this class of steels, marginally increasing the temperature of preheating and post-heating or increasing the duration of post-heating can permit longer delay in the post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), without increasing the risk of environmental degradation. With this objective, a set of thirteen single-V multi-pass gas tungsten arc weld joints of Grade-91 steel fabricated with different preheating and post-heating combinations. Results indicated a significant reduction in residual tensile stresses in the weld metal and reversing into compressive stresses upon preheating and post-heating at 300 degrees C. Moreover, diffusible hydrogen content and corrosion rate decreased significantly with the preheating and post-heating. However, there are no significant variations in the microstructure, mechanical properties, and hydrogen embrittlement with preheating and post-heating. This study proved that the risk of embrittlement in Grade-91 steel welds due to an indefinite delay in PWHT could be minimized by combined preheating and post-heating.

AB The hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviour and mechanism of U75V welded joints (WJs) immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl/hydrogenated solutions were investigated using slow strain rate tensile testing and electrochemical measurements. The WJs exhibited more negative potentials, higher corrosion current densities, slightly higher strength, and higher susceptibility to SCC in a hydrogenated solution than the base metal (BM). The strength and elongation of the WJs and BM significantly decreased after exposure to NaCl/hydrogenated solutions. These findings demonstrated that although U75V is extensively utilized in railway tracks, it is imperative to exercise corrosion protection measures for joints or employ specific corrosion-resistant rails in extreme applications to reduce service risks.

AB The effects of hydrogen content and microstructure inhomogeneity on the fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints were elucidated in detail. Sheets with a thickness of 10 mm were welded using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Samples with varying hydrogen content were prepared using a hydrogen charging technique. The crack growth path and fracture morphology were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopies. FCG rate and fracture toughness tests were conducted to analyze the FCG behavior of welded joints. The results indicated that the hydrogen content and microstructure inhomogeneity of the welded joint had limited effects on the FCG rate in the Paris zone. However, as the hydrogen content increased, the FCG rate in the instability zone increased, and the fracture toughness (KQ) value decreased. The microstructure had a greater effect on the FCG rate in the instability zone; the fluctuation amplitude of the FCG path increased significantly, and brittle fracture intensified. Lamellar alpha in the weld zone (WZ) provided an ideal interface for plastic slip, whereas the hydride accelerated separation from the matrix and formed a diffusion channel, significantly increasing the FCG rate in the instability zone. Cracks in the base metal (BM) primarily propagated along the grain boundary of equiaxed alpha. In the WZ, cracks predominantly propagated along the alpha/beta phase boundary or the hydride and cut through the hydride or alternating lamellar alpha/needle beta grains. The fracture morphology in the fatigue source and Paris zones featured a petal-like pattern with partial fatigue bands and cleavage-like river patterns with local brittle fracture and fatigue bands, respectively. In the instability zone, the morphology was characterized by ductile tearing with brittle fracture or local ductile tearing.

AB Under the "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" goal, the construction of an efficient, low-carbon, and economical energy supply system is of great significance for advancing a dual carbon strategy. In allusion to the integrated energy systems (IES) with hydrogen energy coupling, a hydrogen energy coupling IES low-carbon optimization operation strategy that took account of green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading and dual-incentive demand response was proposed in this paper. First, a hydrogen energy multiuse system composed of an electrolyzer, a hydrogen fuel cell, a methane reactor, and hydrogen energy storage was constructed to make full use of the low-carbon cleaning characteristics of hydrogen energy. Besides, a combined model of hydrogen mixed with natural gas was established to improve the utilization efficiency of hydrogen energy. Second, a dual-incentive demand response model including price incentives and subsidy incentives was constructed to fully use the ability to adjust demand-side resources. Next, in view of the carbon emission reduction mechanism of the green certificate, a green certificate and ladder-type carbon joint trading mechanism was constructed. In addition, a green certificate trading mechanism and a reward and punishment tiered carbon trading mechanism had been introduced separately in the IES optimization operation model to reduce carbon emissions of the system. The calculation simulation sets up different scenarios for comparative analysis. As shown by the results, the proposed model could effectively improve renewable energy consumption capacity and energy utilization efficiency. The effectiveness of hydrogen energy utilization, demand respond, and green certification carbon trading mechanism in improving system economy and low-carbon efficiency is verified.

AB Due to the frequent movements and bending of joint areas such as ankles, knees and wrists, effective wound closure and healing of the skin at joints and moving parts remains a great challenge. Traditional invasive wound closure methods, such as the use of sutures and skin staplers, often result in additional puncture wounds, side effects of anesthesia and severe scarring. Herein, a highly-stretchable, adhesive, transparent and hygroscopic hydrogel for noninvasive joint wound closure is reported. The hydrogel is composed of N-[Tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl] acrylamide (THMA), polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and sodium alginate (SA). THMA contains C--C double bonds and a large number of hydroxyl groups, which can form an interpenetrating network structure with PEGDA and SA through chemical and physical double cross-linking. This hydrogel driven by hydrogen bonds exhibits over 700 % elongation and strong adhesion to various surfaces through energy dissi-pation effects. As a wound repair material, the THMA/PEGDA/SA hydrogel can not only effectively close wounds at moving parts, but also provide a mechanical microenvironment similar to normal skin tissue, promote wound healing and reduce scarring. In addition, the hydrogel can effectively absorb exudate, keep the wound moist and clean, and the transparent appearance facilitates the observation of the wound condition. This adhesive hydrogel is demonstrated to be a promising candidate for wound closure and healing at joints and moving parts.

AB Operating rule curves offer a promising approach to guide the operations of hydro-based power systems, such as reservoirs and hydro-photovoltaic hybrid power systems. Nevertheless, the joint operating rule curves have seldom been derived for the hydro-hydrogen-based power systems, primarily due to the complexities in simultaneously adjusting hydropower and hydrogen power. This study is developed to derive the operating rule curves for a hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system. First, a long-term operation model is built to maximize the guaranteed rate, as well as the total operation revenue obtained from both power generation and hydrogen production. Subsequently, eight operating rule curves are developed to guide the hybrid operation using the inflection point method. Finally, the parameters of operating rule curves are derived using the non- dominated sorting genetic algorithm II under the parameterization-simulation-optimization framework. China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system served as a case study, and the results indicated that the proposed method could effectively derive the operating rule curves. Compared with the traditional operation, the average operation revenue and guaranteed rate of the optimal operating rule curves increased to 4.50 billion CNY kWh (+17.19%) +17.19%) and 0.99 (+11.24%), +11.24%), respectively. These findings indicate that the proposed operating rule curves achieve a commendable balance between economy and reliability.

AB Cracking failure of Incoloy 800H welded joints used for about eight months occurred in hydrogen reformer outlet pigtail tubes. Visual inspection, microscopic examination, chemical composition and microhardness testing were performed to find out the failure mechanism. The results indicated that microcracks were discovered in the fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ). The crack propagation mode was intergranular and irregular. The cracked regions were occupied with some oxides in the fusion zone. The Cr content at the grain boundaries was abnormal and intergranular oxidation was found in the HAZ. The microcracks in the outlet pigtail tubes were caused by stress relaxation, and oxidation at grain boundaries. The intergranular oxidation caused the embrittlement at the grain boundaries during long-term service. From the investigations, it was believed that the failure of welded joints in the outlet pigtail tubes originated from stress relaxation cracking during high temperature service.

AB As onshore installation capacity is limited, the increase in the number of offshore wind turbines (OWT) is a major goal. In that connection, the OWTs continuously increase in size and weight and demand adequate foundations concepts like monopiles or tripods. These components are typically manufactured from welded mild steel plates with thickness up to 200 mm. The predominant welding technique is submerged arc welding (SAW). In accordance with the standards, the occurrence of hydrogen-assisted cracking is anticipated by either a minimum waiting time (MWT, before non-destructive testing of the welded joint is allowed) at ambient or a hydrogen removal heat treatment (HRHT) at elevated temperatures. The effectiveness of both can be estimated by calculation of the diffusion time, i.e., diffusion coefficients. In this study, these coefficients are obtained for the first time for a thick-walled S420G2+M offshore steel grade and its multi-layer SAW joint. The electrochemical permeation technique at ambient temperature is used for the determination of diffusion coefficients for both the base material and the weld metal. The coefficients are within a range of 10(-5) to 10(-4) mm(2)/s (whereas the weld metal had the lowest) and are used for an analytical and numerical calculation of the hydrogen diffusion and the related MWT. The results showed that long MWT can occur, which would be necessary to significantly decrease the hydrogen concentration. Weld metal diffusion coefficients at elevated temperatures were calculated from hydrogen desorption experiments by carrier gas hot extraction. They are within a range of 10(-3) mm(2)/s and used for the characterization of a HRHT dwell-time. The analytical calculation shows the same tendency of long necessary times also at elevated temperatures. That means the necessary time is strongly influenced by the considered plate thickness and the estimation of any MWT/HRHT via diffusion coefficients should be critically discussed.

AB To address environmental problems such as global warming, improvements in fuel efficiency, motor performance, and collision safety are required. Therefore, weight reduction, high strength, and rigidity have been prioritized in automobile bodies. In this regard, a multimaterial body composed of steel and aluminum alloys has been developed. To evaluate the reliability of a multimaterial body, the effect of hydrogen, which significantly contributes to delay failure, on its strength characteristics must be clarified. In this study, we investigated the evolution of mesoscopic and microscopic damages during tensile shear tests on clinched joints, with and without hydrogen charging. Subsequently, cross-sectional observations and fractography were conducted. The cross-sectional observations showed that cracks initiated at lower loads in the hydrogen-charged specimen, as compared to those in the uncharged specimen. Additionally, longitudinal cracks appeared only on the cross section of the hydrogen-charged specimen. At lower loads where crack initiation was confirmed, submicro voids were observed on the cross section. The fractography results indicated a layered fractured surface with submicro dimples on the hydrogen-charged specimen and a general ductile fractured surface with voids on the uncharged specimen. These results indicate that hydrogen causes the damage to evolve from primarily void coalescence to longitudinal crack coalescence. Additionally, prior to the formation of a main crack and longitudinal cracks, submicro voids are initiated. These initiation and growth mechanisms indicate that even on plastic deformation joints, hydrogen enhances localized plasticity and damage evolution, thereby reducing tensile shear strength.

AB Herein, the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of base material and gas metal arc welds from a high-strength low-alloy steel grade S690QL by slow strain rate test (SSRT) with in situ hydrogen charging is investigated. To investigate the influence of welding process parameters on the HE susceptibility of welded joints, gas metal arc welds in multilayer technique with two different heat inputs are conducted. The results reveal a considerable loss of fracture elongation for all hydrogen-charged specimens when compared with the uncharged reference conditions. If the higher heat input is chosen, the required minimum yield strength in the weld metal (WM) is not achieved. It is remarkable that this WM also revealed increased HE susceptibility as measured by the relative elongation loss, despite its higher ductility associated with the lower strength level. In combination with hydrogen measurements and fracture surface analysis, the crack propagation mechanisms and related HE mechanisms are intensively discussed.

ID POWER-SYSTEM FLEXIBILITY; RESERVE
AB Power systems are striving for the decarbonization goal for long-term sustainability. As a result, the renewable energy sources (RES) have been playing an increasingly important role in the generation portfolio. Power system flexibility maintaining the power balance under uncertain and variable RES generation has become a major concern during the energy transition. This paper proposes to apply new energy vehicles (NEV) including electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as day-ahead flexibility resources to make revenue by providing comprehensive capacity/energy flexibility in the ancillary service market. First, the detailed joint optimized operational strategies of the NEV fleet and the EV charging/hydrogen refuelling stations are formulated. Second, the design and service clearing methodology of the ancillary service market for flexibility enhancement is introduced. A game-theoretic model is applied to determine the equilibrium price for both the demand and suppliers (namely NEV fleets) of operational flexibility. Third, case studies using IEEE benchmark systems are provided to validate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the joint optimization of NEV fleets, charging stations, and hydrogen refuelling stations can improve the power system operational flexibility, reduce the charging expense of NEV owners, and reduce the carbon emission by utilizing the green hydrogen.

AB The stress corrosion cracking behavior of an Incoloy825/X65 bimetallic composite pipe welded joint in wet hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environment was investigated by means of the creviced bent beam (CBB) test in this study. The microstructure, element distribution and crack propagation behavior of the welded joint were analyzed by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results showed that two types of cracks were observed in the Incoloy825/X65 bimetallic composite pipe welded joint in wet H2S environment, they initiated from the notch and the intersection of the three zones (cladding Incoloy825, base X65 and weld), respectively, and propagated along the fusion boundary(FB) and the Type-II-like grain boundary. The mechanisms of the two types of cracks are due to the combination of anodic dissolution, stress and hydrogen. Near the FB, there are high angle grain boundaries, Type-I, Type-II and the Type-II-like grain boundaries, which have high SCC sensitivity. The element distribution in the intersection of the three zones and the crack tip is complex, with element diffusion, Cr loss and large residual strain. All these provide the conditions for cracks initiation and propagation.

AB It is demonstrated, using tandem mass spectrometry and radio, frequency ion trap, that the adsorption of a H atom on the gold dimer cation, Au2H+, prevents its dissociation and allows for adsorption of CO. Reaction kinetics are measured by employing a radio frequency ion trap where Au-2(+) and CO interact for a given reaction time. The effect of a hydrogen atom is evaluated by comparing reaction fate constants measured for An(2)(+) arid Au2H+. The theoretical results for the adsorption of CO molecules and their reaction characteristics with Au-2(+) and Au2H+ are found to agree with the experimental findings. The joint investigations provide insights into hydrogen atom adsorption effects and consequent reaction mechanisms.

AB A relationship between carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been described in different pathological conditions, but their interaction in modulating joint pain has not yet been investigated. In young female mice with monosodium acetate-induced joint degeneration and pain, we assessed: (1) the effects of CORM-2 (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II)dimer), a CO-releasing molecule, and CoPP (cobalt protoporphyrin IX), an inducer of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), administered alone and combined with low doses of two slow-releasing H2S donors, DADS (diallyl disulfide) and GYY4137 (morpholin-4-ium 4-methoxyphenyl(morpholino) phosphinodithioate dichloromethane complex) on the mechanical allodynia and loss of grip strength provoked by joint degeneration; (2) the role of Nrf2, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and HO-1 in the antinociceptive actions of H2S donors; (3) the impact of DADS and GYY4137 treatment on the expression of Nrf2 and several antioxidant proteins in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Our data showed that treatment with H2S donors inhibited allodynia and functional deficits, while CORM-2 and CoPP only prevented allodynia. The Nrf2 pathway is implicated in the analgesic actions of DADS and GYY4137 during joint degeneration. Moreover, the co-administration of low doses of CORM-2 or CoPP with DADS or GYY4137 produced higher antiallodynic effects and greater recovery of grip strength deficits than those produced by each of these compounds alone. The activation of the antioxidant system caused by H2S donors in DRG and/or PAG might explain the enhancement of antinociceptive effects. These data reveal a positive interaction between H2S and CO in modulating joint pain in female mice.

AB The bonding between titanium alloy and carbon fiber reinforced thermal plastic (CFRTP) has become a favorable approach to realize lightweight fabrication in the aviation and locomotive industries. However, the metal-plastic bonded joints were generally weak. Different from the traditional interfacial bonding mechanism, the role of hydrogen bonds between functional groups at the metal-plastic interface is currently of great interest. In this work, laser joining of Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) to CFRTP was performed. To enhance the bonding strength, surface modification including micro-arc oxidation (MAO) and silane coupling agent (SCA) treatment were adopted. The results indicated that porous structure after the MAO process could increase TC4 surface roughness and promote mechanical interlocking of TC4 surface to the molten CFRTP substrate. Simultaneously, the porous structure enhanced the adsorption content of hydroxyl groups on the surface of TC4 significantly, which optimized the chemical condition of TC4 surface. Selected silane coupling agent of.-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (KH550) could directionally introduce amino groups (-NH2) to TC4 surface, while maintaining the physical morphology of TC4 surface. Hydrogen bonds were thus induced between functional groups, which were proved by red- and blue-shift of typical functional groups wavenumber. The interfacial bonded force reached maximum value of 1813 N, which was further increased by 29.96% due to the interaction of hydrogen bonds.

AB The effect of hydrogen addition on compression deformation behaviour of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joint has been investigated. Evolution mechanism of hydrogen-induced flow stress was discussed in detail. The results show that with increasing hydrogen content, the stretching and bending extent of fully lamellar microstructures including alpha lamellas and acicular hydride continued to increase, the morphology of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains tended to change from approximately equiaxed to large lamellar shape, and the quantity of DRX grains and recrystallization degree of grains increased obviously. A large number of dislocations concentrated in the vicinity of the hydride. Steady stress was decreased continuously with increasing hydrogen content, while peak stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 wt.% H weld zone was decreased to the minimum value and then increased slowly. A slight decrease in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.05 wt.% H weld zone was caused by limited increase in the volume fraction of softer beta phase. Hydrogen-induced DRX of alpha phase and improved dislocation movement by strong interaction between the hydride and dislocation directly resulted in a sharp drop in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 and 0.21 wt.% H weld zone. Solute hydrogen also finitely contributed to a sharp drop in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.12 and 0.21 wt.% H weld zone by promoted local softening, which induced continuous DRX and more movable dislocations to participate in slipping or climbing. The reinforcement effect and plastic deformation of the hydride and solution strengthening of beta phase induced by solute hydrogen finally led to the increase in flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.% H weld zone in its true strain range from 0 to 0.36.

AB With the emergence of distributed resources (DRs), developing an effective, profitable, and green management method is of great importance. Virtual power plant (VPP) can aggregate various DRs, optimize their schedules, and participate in electricity markets uniformly to earn profit. The optimal scheduling problem in spot market has been widely studied, however, few studies have extended the services of VPP to the long-term scale. This paper proposes a coordinated scheduling method for a multi-energy virtual power plant (MEVPP), considering the integration of hydrogen facilities. A holistic market framework, including capacity market, energy market (EM), and ancillary service market (ASM) is developed jointly for the coordination among the annual capacity schedule, daily energy schedule, and daily reserve schedule of MEVPP. A hybrid hydrogen storage system including daily hydrogen storage and seasonal hydrogen storage is modeled to achieve both intraday and cross-seasonal peak shaving. Stochastic programming is used to tackle the uncertainties and risk management is considered by conditional value at risk. With the help of numerical analysis in case studies, it can be concluded that the proposed coordinated scheduling method can improve the economy of MEVPP. The profit from joint market decreases the total cost by about 52 %. The capacity adequacy and flexibility of MEVPP can be improved by the coordination of capacity and reserve services. The hybrid hydrogen storage system can realize the efficient integration of hydrogen and increase hydrogen production and consumption by about 9 %.

AB This study introduces a hydrogen and electricity joint production system that utilizes a very-high-temperature reactor and integrates the iodine-sulfur cycle with the steam Rankine cycle. The system can operate under off-design conditions by adjusting the helium mass flow rates in the main and secondary loops, using constant pressure operation (CPO) or sliding pressure operation (SPO) for the power generation loop. The system's performance is investigated at partial reactor thermal power. The recommended reactor thermal power load ratios range from 63.90 % to 100 % for CPO and from 64.29 % to 100 % for SPO, with the lower limit determined by the steam generator's hot-end temperature difference. The hydrogen production rate and the system's electrical power output both decline with a lower load ratio. Within the recommended load ratios, the hydrogen production rates for CPO and SPO range from 129.44 mol/s to 200 mol/s. With a lower load ratio, the power generation efficiency declines, while the hydrogen-electricity efficiency and system's exergy efficiency first rise and then fall. At a fixed load ratio, the power generation efficiency, hydrogen-electricity efficiency, and system's exergy efficiency are higher using SPO than those using CPO, indicating better off-design performance using SPO.

AB Seawater electrolysis is one of the cost-effective techniques for producing hydrogen. To reduce the initial cost of hydrogen production plants, it is necessary to employ appropriate materials for electrodes, seawater storage, joints, and cell body. We recommend using A516 steel for seawater storage, and cell body. A516 steel is a medium-carbon steel with high strength and wear resistance, easy to work with, 6 times cheaper than stainless steel 316, and is widely used in oil and gas industry. However, it is prone to corrosion. For that, we developed an anticorrosion coating with high thermal and mechanical stress tolerance. The proposed coating is a room-temperature-vulcanizing (RTV) silicone mixed additives, adhesion promoter and fillers. The utilized adhesion promoter enhanced the adhesion by 5-fold, aluminum trihydrate (ATH) decreased the burning distance from 17 mm to 3 mm, and nanoparticles increased the contact angle to more than 160 degrees and contact angle hysteresis less than 3 degrees. The formulated superhydrophobic coating decreased the corrosion rate of A516 steel by 1673-fold from 200 mm/year to 0.12 mm/year. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Constructing compact direct Z- and S-scheme heterostructures is an efficient strategy for realizing a highly efficient charge separation and photocatalytic performance. However, the stochastic nature of interface orientation and lattice mismatch often results in a blind region for effective inner charge transfer, which hinders the logical design of compact heterojunctions. Here, experimental results and theoretical research unveiled that complicated internal charges can be directly transferred to an intermediate cocrystal plane for electron-hole recombination in compact S-scheme heterostructures, called "bone-joint" heterostructures, which facilitate the establishment of an inherent electric field to drive charge transfer. Moreover, those bone-joint structures adjust the inherent chemical and energetic interactions that manipulate the reactant adsorption mode and surface reaction energy. As a result, a synthesized catalyst displayed a remarkable hydrogen peroxide production performance and stability. This offers a paradigm for intrinsic charge transfer dynamics in heterostructures and a guiding philosophy for designing efficient heterostructures.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in joint fluid acts as a signal molecule to regulate joint inflammation. Direct detection of H2S in joint fluid is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis. However, due to the low volume of joint fluid and low H2S concentration, existing methods face the problem of the insufficient limit of detection. In this study, a highly sensitive biosensor was proposed by designing a primer probe and combining it with hybrid chain reaction (HCR) under the strong interaction between metal ions and H2S to achieve H2S detection. The primer probe containing multiple cytosine (C) sequences was fixed on a gold electrode, and the C-Ag-C hairpin structure was formed under the action of Ag+. In the presence of H2S, it can combine with Ag+ in the hairpin structure to form Ag2S, which leads to the opening of the hairpin structure and triggers the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with another two hairpin structures (H1 and H2). A large number of double-stranded nucleic acid structures can be obtained on the electrode surface. Finally, Ru(phen)(3)(2+) can be embedded into the double chain structure to generate the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal. The linear response of the H2S biosensor ranged from 0.1000 to 1500 nM, and the limit of detection concentration of H2S was 0.0398 nM. The developed biosensor was successfully used to determine H2S in joint fluid.

TI Component test for the assessment of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking
   in thick-walled SAW joints for offshore applications
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD

DT Article
DE Hydrogen; Cold cracking; Submerged arc welding; Offshore; Thick plates
ID RESIDUAL-STRESSES; MOCK-UP
AB Offshore wind turbines continuously increase in size and weight and demand adequate offshore foundations concepts like monopiles, tripods, or jackets. These components are typically constructed using submerged arc welding (SAW) with high-strength thick steel plates like the S420ML. During welding, the occurrence of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) must be anticipated. HAC is a critical combination of the local hydrogen concentration within a susceptible microstructure under certain mechanical load, i.e., the occurring (welding) residual stresses. The welding sequence of the thick-walled plates complicates the residual stress distribution due to the necessary repeated thermal cycling, i.e., welding seam/layer deposition to fill the joint. For that purpose, SAW with two-wire-technique was used to weld a specially designed and prototype-like mock-up of a real component with a thickness of 50 mm, filled with over 20 passes and a seam length of 1000 mm. Additional welded stiffeners simulated the effect of a high restraint, to achieve critical HAC conditions. The necessity of a minimum waiting time (MWT) before the NDT can be conducted (to exclude HAC) was critically verified by the application of ultrasonic testing of the welded joint at different time-steps of the NDT of up to 48 h after the completion welding. The residual stresses were determined by a robot XRD goniometer. Tensile residual stresses up to the yield limit are found both in the weld metal and in the heat-affected zone. Numerical modeling allowed the qualitative estimation of the hydrogen diffusion in the weld. No noticeable HAC occurrence was identified and confirms the high cracking resistance of the investigated material. Finally, the applicability of the MWT concept should be critically discussed.

AB The embrittlement mechanisms of the X65 weld joint (WJ) in H2S were investigated using in situ crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) test, electrochemical measurement, weight loss test, and hydrogen permeation test. The weld metal (WM), coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), and base metal (BM) exhibited significant degradation of fracture toughness in H2S, with embrittlement factors (EF) of 89.5 %, 83 %, and 80 %, respectively. The WJ exhibited the lowest corrosion potential in H2S compared to the isolated WM and BM. Notably, the weight loss test revealed a corrosion step along the fusion line (FL), indicating the galvanic corrosion in the CGHAZ. This led to different embrittlement mechanisms associated with hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and anodic dissolution (AD). Hydrogen-assisted plastic strain localization in grain boundary ferrite (GBF) resulted in HE-driven cleavage cracking in the WM. In contrast, as galvanic corrosion was promoted, the fracture toughness degradation of CGHAZ was governed by the combined effects of HE and AD. The crack propagation followed a cyclic process of cleavage-blunting-reactivation, corresponding to a fracture morphology of alternating cleavage planes and "trench-like" ductile tears. The HE accelerated the cleavage cracking along the {110} plane, while AD inhibited crack tip blunting through preferential dissolution along the {100}, {110}, and {112} planes.

AB A comprehensive and hierarchical optimization of a joint hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanism has been carried out. The Keromnes et al. (Combust Flame, 2013, 160, 995-1011) mechanism for syngas combustion was updated with our recently optimized hydrogen combustion mechanism (Varga et al., Proc Combust Inst, 2015, 35, 589-596) and optimized using a comprehensive set of direct and indirect experimental data relevant to hydrogen and syngas combustion. The collection of experimental data consisted of ignition measurements in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, burning velocity measurements, and species profiles measured using shock tubes, flow reactors, and jet-stirred reactors. The experimental conditions covered wide ranges of temperatures (800-2500 K), pressures (0.5-50 bar), equivalence ratios (phi = 0.3-5.0), and C/H ratios (0-3). In total, 48 Arrhenius parameters and 5 third-body collision efficiency parameters of 18 elementary reactions were optimized using these experimental data. A large number of directly measured rate coefficient values belonging to 15 of the reaction steps were also utilized. The optimization has resulted in a H-2/CO combustion mechanism, which is applicable to a wide range of conditions. Moreover, new recommended rate parameters with their covariance matrix and temperature-dependent uncertainty ranges of the optimized rate coefficients are provided. The optimized mechanism was compared to 19 recent hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanisms and is shown to provide the best reproduction of the experimental data. (C) 2016 The Authors.

DE hydrogen energy storage; two-stage P2G; adjustable thermoelectric ratio
AB With the continuous development of hydrogen storage systems, power-to-gas (P2G) and combined heat and power (CHP), the coupling between electricity-heat-hydrogen-gas has been promoted and energy conversion equipment has been transformed from an independent operation with low energy utilization efficiency to a joint operation with high efficiency. This study proposes a low-carbon optimization strategy for a multi-energy coupled IES containing hydrogen energy storage operating jointly with a two-stage P2G adjustable thermoelectric ratio CHP. Firstly, the hydrogen energy storage system is analyzed to enhance the wind power consumption ability of the system by dynamically absorbing and releasing energy at the right time through electricity-hydrogen coupling. Then, the two-stage P2G operation process is refined and combined with the CHP operation with an adjustable thermoelectric ratio to further improve the low-carbon and economic performance of the system. Finally, multiple scenarios are set up, and the comparative analysis shows that the addition of a hydrogen storage system can increase the wind power consumption capacity of the system by 4.6%; considering the adjustable thermoelectric ratio CHP and the two-stage P2G, the system emissions reduction can be 5.97% and 23.07%, respectively, and the total cost of operation can be reduced by 7.5% and 14.5%, respectively.

AB Transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, particularly MoS2, are known as promising alternative non-precious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts to high-cost Pt. However, their performance is strongly limited by the poor conductivity and lack of active sites in the basal plane. Therefore, it is desirable to find alternatives with active basal plane sites or develop facile strategies to optimize the inert basal plane. In this work, we study the HER over topological semimetal Nb2S2C based on its basal plane. We report the first successful activation and optimization of the basal plane of Nb2S2C by synergistic using trivial surface states (SSs) and nontrivial topological surface states (TSSs). We find that the binding strength towards hydrogen adsorption of the easily cleaved sulfur(S)-terminated Nb2S2C surface can be stronger than that of 2H-MoS2, attributing to the presence of trivial SSs and nontrivial TSSs in Nb2S2C. By creating S vacancy on the basal plane, the binding strength towards hydrogen adsorption can be greatly optimized. The TSSs together with dangling-bonds reduce the Gibbs free energy to 0.31 eV, close to the peak of the volcano plot. This study provides a promising strategy for the joint utilization of the basal plane trivial SSs and TSSs for the HER. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB ASTM A 182 F22 steel, used in components subsea for oil extraction, are previously buttered with ductile metal such as Inconel 625, before being welded to steel pipes similar to ASTM A36 steels. The thermal buttering weld cycle provides the formation of high hardness micro-phases and carbides at the interface between F22 steel and the buttering with Inconel, which when in contact with hydrogen, originating from the cathodic protection applied to these equipment, can lead to the embrittlement of this region, causing fragile fractures. In this work, ASTM A 182 F22 steel, buttered with Inconel 625 and welded to A36 steel, submitted to post-weld heat treatment without hydrogenation and subjected to cathodic protection for hydrogen permeation were submitted to fracture toughness test. The welds and buttering were done using GMAW process with AWS ERNiCrMo-3 wire as filler and buttering metal and a mixture of Ar and He as shield gas. The results indicated a 56% of area reduction, and 15% in the elongation values in the tensile tests, in addition to a 13.3% reduction in the CTOD value, for welded joints subjected to hydrogen permeation, which showed a quasi-cleavage fracture mechanism.

AB As operating temperatures and times continue to increase for solder joints with Ni pads, large voids inevitably form at the intermetallic compound (IMC) - solder interface when the IMC thickness nears 5 mu m. This leads to a significant reduction of strength, thermal conductivity, and fatigue resistance, and in small joints, also to electromigration life degradation. We have identified the voiding root cause as the breakdown and subsequent outgassing of deposition-related Ni-oxo-hydroxide impurities, impractical to avoid during Ni commercial electroplating. This work takes as the starting point a successful post-deposition voiding-mitigation treatment with 24-hour annealing at 450 degrees C. It then explores the possibility of rendering this routine more practical by lowering the annealing temperature down to 250 degrees C. While that approach shows relatively limited success, an alternative strategy, involving treatment with hydrogen evolution reaction for one hour at room temperature, alone or in combination with thermal, leads to a substantial reduction in the voiding propensity.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility and hydrogen permeation behavior of reeling pipeline welded joint with/without cyclic plastic deformation (CPD) were studied using the electrochemical hydrogen charging technique. Results indicated that the surface of welded joint emerged hydrogen-induced damage containing cracks and blisters. The degree of hydrogen-induced damage increased with the increase of hydrogen charging time and current density. When the hydrogen charging current density and time was 50 mA/cm2 and 4 h, respectively, the area ratio of hydrogen-induced damage of overall welded joint with CPD process was reduced from 6.61% to 2.28%, and the damage ratio of different sub-zones in welded joint was also decreased. The oxidized inclusions enriching Al-Mg-Ca elements acted as the initiation sites for hydrogen-induced damages. The effective diffusion coefficient of as welded joint was 2.63 x 10-6 cm2/s, while that of welded joint with CPD showed a smaller value of 1.36 x 10-6 cm2/s. The welded joint with CPD process presented better resistance to HE, which was attributed to the increased density of hydrogen traps and the formation of dislocation cells to disperse hydrogen uniformly and reduce the possibility of local accumulation and recombination of diffusible hydrogen. Sub-zones in welded joint without CPD process were considerably more sensitive to hydrogen-induced damage, which indicated the important role of microstructure and dislocation density in HE mechanisms. The order of HE susceptibility from low to high was weld metal, base metal and heat affected zone.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and it is a leading cause of disability in the elderly. Its complete etiology is not known although there are several metabolic, genetic, epigenetic, and local contributing factors involved. At the moment, there is no cure for this pathology and treatment alternatives to retard or stop its progression are intensively being sought. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a small gaseous molecule and is present in sulfurous mineral waters as its active component. Data from recent clinical trials shows that balneotherapy (immersion in mineral and/or thermal waters from natural springs) in sulfurous waters can improve OA symptoms, in particular, pain and function. Yet, the underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Hydrogen sulfide is also considered, with NO and CO, an endogenous signaling gasotransmitter. It is synthesized endogenously with the help of three enzymes, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MPST). Here, the expression of these three enzymes was demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and their protein abundance [by immunohistochemistry and Western blot (WB)] in human articular cartilage. No significant differences were found in CBS or CTH expression or abundance, but mRNA and protein levels of 3-MPST were significantly reduced in cartilage form OA donors. Also, the biosynthesis of H2S from OA cartilage, measured with a specific microelectrode, was significantly lower than in OA-free tissue. Yet, no differences were found in H2S concentration in serum from OA patients and OA-free donors. The current results suggest that reduced levels of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-MPST in OA cartilage might be, at least in part, responsible for a reduction in H2S biosynthesis in this tissue and that impaired H2S biosynthesis in the joint might be a contributing factor to OA. This could contribute to explain why exogenous supplementation of H2S, for instance with sulfurous thermal water, has positive effects in OA patients.

AB The effects of pre-strain on hydrogen embrittlement of 304L K-TIG welded joint were investigated. As pre-strain of joint increased, fracture location of hydrogen-charged joint changed from weld metal to base metal. In low prestrained joints, fracture may be initiated at the sites of clustered dislocations due to hydrogen in weld metal with a high density of pre-existing dislocations. In high prestrained joints, some regions in base metal suffered severe strain-induced alpha' martensitic transformation due to Ni depletion bands and cracking occurred at phase boundaries where may provide more sites for the accumulation of hydrogen atoms and dislocations.

AB Hydrogen dissolved from the moisture or the wire filler is formed on the surface of welded joint due to the driving of high-energy heat source. The diffused hydrogen in the welded joint could cause hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The important factors determining the HE resistance of welded joints are microstructure style, dislocation distribution, grains characteristics, precipitate particle, and residual stress. Different welding technologies show various heat sources and heat cycles, which result in different characteristics of fusion zone and heat-affected zone. Thus, the HE fracture behavior of welded joint produced by different welded technologies differs greatly. The current stage of HE behavior of welded joint was reviewed to provide fundamental reference for the scientists and engineers engaging in welding. The appearance of hydrogen atoms in the surface or interior of welded joint could weaken the bonding strength and change the fracture mode from ductile to sudden brittle fracture. Generally, the controlling of filler wire and heat input is a practical route to obtain the excellent welded joint with high HE resistance. The inhibition of hydrogen diffusion via the formation of fine coating and the aggregation of hydrogen atoms via the control of microstructure and precipitates are the effective routes to improve HE resistance.

AB The joint effect of the non-ideality (NI) of classical plasma and a static electric field on the energy levels of the hydrogen atom has been investigated theoretically. A two-parameter pseudopotential, derived from Bogolyubov chain equations, is used to model the interactions of the charged particles in classical non-ideal plasma (NICP). Energies of the bound states are computed variationally by employing a trial wavefunction, which is a linear expansion of the accurate eigenstates representing the bound states of the hydrogen atom embedded in NICP. The computed bound state energies of the atom under the combined influence of NICP and a static electric field are found to be convergent with respect to the expanding size of the wavefunction. A comprehensive study is made on the changes emerging in the energy levels due to the variation of the NI of plasma as well as the strength of the electric field. It is found that the effect of the electric field on the non-degenerate ground state is reciprocally opposite to the effect of NICP. The effect of the electric field can be neutralized by increasing the NI of the plasma. Moreover, degeneracy in the azimuthal quantum number pertaining to the excited states is lifted either by the influence of the plasma or by the influence of the electric field. When the effects of the plasma and the electric field are taken together, extended splitting of the energy levels is observed. (c) 2025 Author(s).

AB The susceptibility of various sections of a gas distribution pipeline, operated for 52 years, to hydrogen embrittlement was analyzed. The specimens of base metal and welded joint, cut out transversally to the pipe generatrix, were tested. The brittle fracture resistance was assessed based on temperature dependences of impact toughness and changes in steel plasticity after its electrolytic hydrogen charging. Critically low impact toughness was determined for both the base metal and welded joint of the operated pipeline. It was revealed that preliminary electrolytic hydrogen charging caused the plasticity loss, which was more pronounced for the welded joint and the operated state of the material.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) occurs as a result of hydrogen atom ingress and causes a significant decrease in plasticity and strength, making it a crucial failure mode in high-strength low-alloy steels. The microstructure plays a vital role in HE fracture behavior because of the various hydrogen trappings. The welding thermal cycle and alloying elements determine the great difference of the microstructure of the welded joint. Thus, this article reviews the current studies investigating the role of the microstructure in determining the HE behavior of the welded joints, thereby aiming to reveal the fracture process and mechanism. Dislocations and inclusions in welded joints reduce HE resistance. Acicular ferrite with a fine interlocking structure can block the prolonging of hydrogen-induced cracking. The transformation of the retained austenite with a high concentration of hydrogen atoms into martensite accelerates HE fractures. The delta-ferrite in the welded joint promotes the HE resistance deterioration and hydrogen-induced cracking. Appropriate coating of the steel surface is an effective approach for preventing HE fractures.

DE TC4 titanium alloy; welded joint; slow strain rate tensile tests;
   hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility
AB The microstructure of tungsten-inert-gas (TIG)-welded TC4 titanium alloy joints was analyzed. The stress-corrosion behavior and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the welded joints were also studied by performing slow strain rate tensile tests (SSRTs) in 3.5% NaCl solution. The results show that the heat-affected zone was mainly composed of alpha, beta, and alpha' phases, in which the alpha' phase comprised a coarse-grain region with a reticulated morphology. During tensile tests, the stress-corrosion sensitivity of the welded joints increased with increasing strain. The greatest stress-corrosion sensitivity occurred at a strain rate of 0.24 mm/min, where the joint fractured at the fusion line. Regarding the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity, the fracture strength of the joints increased and the elongation percentage decreased with increasing polarization potential. In addition, the fracture surface was primarily composed of dimples, showing that the joints were not sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) susceptibility of the welded X100 pipeline steel was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature according to the NACE TM0284-2011 standard. Both the kinetic parameters of the permeability (J(infinity)L), the apparent diffusivity (D-app) and the concentration of reversible and irreversible hydrogen in the base metal and welded joint of X100 pipeline steel were quantitatively investigated by hydrogen permeation test. The results showed that the welded joint with an inhomogeneous microstructure had a higher trap density and more susceptible to HIC due to two orders of magnitude larger in the concentration of irreversible hydrogen than that of base metal, though all presenting poor HIC resistance for both base metal and the welded joint. The HIC cracks initiated from the inclusions enriching in Al, Ca, Si, Mn. The cracks are primarily trans granular, accompanying with limited intergranular ones.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) shows promise as an energy carrier in contributing to emissions reductions from sectors which have been difficult to decarbonize, like industry and transportation. At the same time, flexible H-2 production via electrolysis can also support cost-effective integration of high shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. In this work, we develop a least-cost investment planning model to co-optimize investments in electricity and H-2 infrastructure to serve electricity and H-2 demands under various low-carbon scenarios. Applying the model to a case study of Texas in 2050, we find that H-2 is produced in approximately equal amounts from electricity and natural gas under the least-cost expansion plan with a CO2 price of $30-60/tonne. An increasing CO2 price favors electrolysis, while increasing H-2 demand favors H-2 production from Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) of natural gas. H-2 production is found to be a cost effective solution to reduce emissions in the electric power system as it provides flexibility otherwise provided by natural gas power plants and enables high shares of VRE with less battery storage. Additionally, the availability of flexible electricity demand via electrolysis makes carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment for SMR cost-effective at lower CO2 prices ($90/tonne CO2) than for power generation ($180/tonne CO2). The total emissions attributable to H-2 production is found to be dependent on the H-2 demand. The marginal emissions from H-2 production increase with the H-2 demand for CO2 prices less than $90/tonne CO2, due to shift in supply from electrolysis to SMR. For a CO2 price of $60/tonne we estimate the production weighted-average H-2 price to be between $1.30-1.66/kg across three H-2 demand scenarios. These findings indicate the importance of joint planning of electricity and H-2 infrastructure for cost-effective energy system decarbonization. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Pipeline steels for sour oil and gas containing H2S generally suffer from either hydrogeninduced cracking (HIC) or sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSC). Oil and gas containing high concentration H2S are noxious to pipeline steels because of the hydrogen- induced corrosion. In this study, HIC susceptibility of welded MS X70 pipeline steels was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature. Meanwhile, microstructure and regions near a HIC crack in the MS X70 base steel and its welded joint were analyzed through OM, SEM and EBSD. The hydrogen trapping efficiency was also investigated by measuring the permeability (J(infinity)) and the effective hydrogen diffusivity (D-eff). The results showed that both base metal and welded joint were highly susceptible to HIC and the later steel sample was more vulnerable than the former. This higher susceptibility could be primarily attributed to the following effects: the higher hydrogen trapping efficiency of bainitic lath microstructure in the welded joint; the more low angle grain boundary in the welded joint also made it easier to crack by improving the hydrogen trapping efficiency of high angle grain boundary; the less amount of coincidence site lattice grain boundary and Sigma 13b. Sigma 29b lead to higher HIC susceptibility by decreasing the resistance to crack of high angle grain boundary.

AB The effects of hydrogen concentration, heating rate and bonding temperature on dissimilar diffusion bonding of Ti2AlNb-based and Ti-6Al-4V alloys were investigated. The microstructural evolutions of bonded joints and substrates during the diffusion bonding were observed using SEM and EDS while the mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated by shear tests. The average joint shear strength was found dependent on the diffusion zone width determined from EDS line scan. The typical joint interface shows a layered microstructure, comprising Ti2AlNb substrate, continuous beta layer, discontinuous alpha layer, equiaxed beta layer and Ti-6Al-4V substrate. If both substrates are hydrogenated with 0.2 wt% hydrogen before diffusion bonding, a sound joint can be formed at 850 degrees C with a fast heating rate. This sound joint has a shear strength of 711 MPa, and its Ti-6Al-4V substrate favors a non-damaged bimodal microstructure. The fast heating rate also causes less hydrogen desorption and oxidation during the heating stage, which facilitates the subsequent diffusion bonding process. The hydrogen addition influences the diffusion bonding process through three main routes including plasticity improvement, diffusion ability enhancement and microstructure tailoring.

AB The effects of elapsed time following gas metal arc welding (GMAW) on the static strength of lap fillet-welded joints were investigated using a static tensile test. It was observed that the static joint strength did not exhibit a time dependency for cases where the fracture was located in each base metal or the softened heat affected zone (HAZ). in addition, the static joint strength was not observed to have a time dependency for cases where a wire with low-hardness weld metal was used and where the fracture was located in the weld metal. However, the static joint strength was low immediately after welding, and increased over time when a wire with high-hardness weld metal was used. It was found that diffusible hydrogen that entered the weld metal during arc welding and was emitted over time was the cause of the time dependency of joint strength. High-hardness weld metal was sensitive to diffusible hydrogen; therefore, time dependency was observed only when wires with high-hardness weld metal were used and the fracture positions were located in the weld metal during tensile tests. In addition, a correlation between the storage temperature following welding and the static strength or diffusible hydrogen content of welded parts was found: the higher the storage temperature, the earlier the joint strength increases, and the earlier the diffusible hydrogen decreases.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility is intrinsically linked to the material's microstructural characteristics. This study systematically investigated API X52 pipeline steel through in-situ tensile testing under 6 MPa hydrogen pressure, complemented by microstructural characterization, fractographic analysis, and hydrogen microprint test (HMT). A comparative assessment of hydrogen embrittlement resistance was conducted between base metal and welded joints, particularly on microstructural influences on failure mechanisms. It was found that under a 6 MPa hydrogen environment, the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of the API X52 base metal selected in this article is higher than that of the welded joint. A gradient microstructural distribution was observed along the direction of the pipe wall thickness. The outer wall region predominantly consists of polygonal ferrite with a minor fraction of granular bainite. A progressive increase in bainitic phase fraction was detected toward the inner wall, ultimately transitioning to bainite structures. Secondary cracks appear on the tensile fracture surface of the base metal under a hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa. The cracks mainly originate from granular carbides and propagate along the grain boundaries. HMT analysis revealed preferential hydrogen segregation at the carbide or grain boundary. The precipitated carbides at grain boundaries play a significant role in hydrogen trapping, and the hydrogen accumulation at the interface between precipitated carbides and the matrix is the main reason for transgranular fracture. The tensile fracture of the welded joints in nitrogen and 6 MPa hydrogen environments was found in the softened zone of the heat-affected zone. The failure mode of the welded joint was mainly dominated by strength and had no hydrogen-induced failure characteristics.

AB In this study, the hydrogen embrittlement and fracture mechanism of friction stir welded Q&P980 steel were investigated systematically. It was found that the intercritical heat affected zone was most susceptible and the stir zone was resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. The hydrogen-induced cracks initiated and propagated along the grain boundaries of ferrite and martensite or inside the martensite. This was attributed to the strain and stress concentration caused by the martensite and ferrite and the large-angle grain boundary formed during thermal cycle of welding process. With the charging time increased from 10 min to 16 h, the strength decreased by similar to 5% whereas the elongation decreased from 10.2% to 3.1% dramatically, which indicated that the hydrogen diffused into the joints had serious effect on elongation. At lower strain rates (1 x 10(-5) s(-1)), hydrogen moved with dislocations and accumulated which promoted the initiation of microcracks and occurrence of fracture ultimately. The fracture surfaces changed from ductile mode for uncharged weld joint to brittle mode for charged weld joint. In addition, the TRIP effect of retained austenite in SCHAZ during tensile test process aggravated the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement which accelerated the nucleation and propagation of hydrogen-induced cracks, and thus intergranular fracture occurred in charged weld joints.Y

AB Zr-4 alloys were hydrogenated by gaseous hydrogen charging and then diffusion bonded using pure Ti interlayers to maintain a low bonding temperature while obtaining high strength. The effects of the hydrogen content and holding time on Zr-4-xH alloys (x represents the hydrogen content in wt.%) and their joints were investigated. Results show that the added hydrogen enhances the diffusion behavior during bonding and the joint quality. The layer growth rates and interdiffusion coefficients at the Ti/Zr-4-xH interlayer were calculated using the empirical power function and the Boltzmann-Matano method to confirm the diffusion enhancement. The flow stress and Young's modulus were also measured, demonstrating the improvement in plasticity. Specifically, the diffusion layer thickness (14.5 mu m) and shear strength (353 MPa) of the joint (0.5 wt% hydrogen, bonded at 700 degrees C and 15 MPa for 60 min) were 16% and 178% higher than those in the case without hydrogenation, respectively. This pre-hydrogenation method reduces the bonding temperature and improves the joint strength, thus advancing the industrial application of Zr alloys.

AB Addressing hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the welded joints of high-strength pipeline steels is critical for ensuring the safety and integrity of future hydrogen transmission networks. Due to complex thermal cycles during welding, the heterogeneous microstructure and residual stresses render these joints the most susceptible component of the pipeline structure. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of research on the HE susceptibility of pipeline steel weldments. The review first evaluates mainstream HE theories, such as Hydrogen-Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE) and Hydrogen-Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP), concluding that the synergistic interaction between multiple mechanisms is key to understanding the failure process. A comprehensive comparison of multi-scale characterization techniques, from macroscopic mechanical tests to microscopic hydrogen mapping, is then conducted, underscoring the necessity of an integrated framework to accurately assess HE risk. Furthermore, the influence of critical material factors-including phase constituents, grain boundary characteristics, dislocation density, and precipitates-on HE sensitivity is thoroughly analyzed. Ultimately, this review aims to establish a comprehensive analytical framework for HE failure in welded joints, providing a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the development of advanced, hydrogen-resistant welding technologies.

AB Tungsten-argon arc welding (TIG) of Zr-702 zirconium plate was carried out with 99.999% high purity Ar as shielding gas and the corrosion resistance of Zr-702 welded joint immersed in 15wt% sulfuric acid at 250 degrees C for 2 and 180 d was studied by static isothermal mass loss method. The results show that the corrosion rate of the welded joint is higher than that of the base metal in the immersion test for different time. When soaking for 2 d, both the welding joint and the base metal have good corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of welded joints deteriorates when the soaking time is extended to 180 d, and the corrosion rate of welded joints is greatly affected by the soaking time. Further analysis results show that the corrosion of base metal in sulfuric acid medium is mainly uniform. For welded joints, a large amount of zirconium hydride is precipitated in the weld zone and heat-affected zone, showing the characteristics of hydrogen corrosion. At the same time, the welded joint exhibits remarkable gradient structure and potential difference, so its corrosion is local corrosion combined with galvanic corrosion and hydrogen corrosion.

AB Hydrogen induced cold cracking (HICC) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) are influenced by themicrostructural evolution, residual plastic strain (i.e. local misorientation), recrystallization of grains and the resultant grain boundary characteristic distribution (GBCD) brought about by welding processes. HICC and HE are known to cause failures in aerospace components and it is vitally important to quantify the microstructural evolution, degree of residual plastic strain and determine the GBCD across dissimilar weld joints in order to assess the susceptibility of the weld joint to these phenomena. In this investigation a full a microstructural characterization study was carried out at various locations within and around a dissimilar weld joint of pulse-plated nickel (PP-Ni) and Inconel 718 (IN718), taken froman aerospace component. Areas examined included the base metals, weld fusion zone and heat affected zones on both sides of the weld joint, formed via electron beam welding. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was employed to measure the residual plastic strain, grain structure, grain size distribution, crystal orientation distribution, grain boundary misorientation distribution and GBCD of the dissimilar metal weld joint. Finally ametallurgical examinationwas carried out using SEMon the IN718 HAZ in order to investigate the secondary phase precipitation arising fromthe welding process. The results shows large variety of GBCD, crystallographic orientation distribution, local plastic strain distribution and grain size, shape and structure distribution across dissimilar weld joint. And these localized microstructural characterized data sets need to be carefully transferred using data-driven approach in order to develop predictive multiscale material modelling for hydrogen induced cracking and hydrogen embrittlement.

AB To reveal the influence of hydrogen on the characteristics of defect-free titanium alloy welded joints, the effects of hydrogen addition on the precipitation behavior in the hydrogenated 0.12 wt.%H weld zone of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc-welded joints have been investigated. The results showed that lamellar delta-hydride (face-centered cubic) could only precipitate from alpha-lamellae, but not from the transformed beta-phase due to the high hydrogen solubility in beta-phase. Formation of delta-hydride was the result of the alpha(H)-phase separation reaction: alpha(H) -> alpha (H-lean region) + delta (H-rich region). The formation mechanism of the relatively massive delta-hydride in the alpha(H) -matrix was mainly based on the combined effects of harsh stress field states and stringent hydrogen content requirements. A sharp drop in elongation and a slight increase in weld zone hardness of the hydrogenated welded joint were associated with delta-hydride precipitation.

AB The paper describes structure and properties of dissimilar stainless steels welded joints between duplex 2205 and austenitic 316L steels. Investigations were focused on environmentally assisted cracking of welded joints. The susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and hydrogen embrittlement was determined in slow strain rate tests (SSRT) with the strain rate of 2.2 x 10(-6) s(-1). Chloride-inducted SCC was determined in the 35% boiling water solution of MgCl2 environment at 125 degrees C. Hydrogen assisted SCC tests were performed in synthetic sea water under cathodic polarization condition. It was shown that place of the lowest resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking is heat affected zone at duplex steel side of dissimilar joins. That phenomenon was connected with undesirable structure of HAZ comprising of large fractions of ferrite grains with acicular austenite phase. Hydrogen assisted SCC tests showed significant reduction in ductility of duplex 2205 steel while austenitic 316L steel remains almost immune to degradation processes. SSR tests of dissimilar welded joints revealed a fracture in the area of austenitic steel.

AB Multi-layered steel vessel (MLSV) for high-pressure hydrogen storage is an important equipment in hydrogen refueling station and periodic inspection is necessary to be carried out on it. Welded joint between the head and thick-walled nozzle of the vessel is the key point of the inspection. In this study, based on structural characteristics of MLSV, a method of inserted curved surface coupling phased array ultrasonic inspection (PAUI) was proposed. In order to achieve effective inspection on the welded joint, acoustic field calculation model of the welded joint by PAUI was established. Influences of various inspection parameters on the acoustic field were analyzed by considering difficulties of far detection distance, wide detection area and large material attenuation systematically to obtain optimized parameters and scanning method. Corresponding probe was subsequently made according to the analysis, and experiment was carried out on test block to prove effectiveness of the method in this study.

AB The Electric-Hydrogen Virtual Power Plant aggregates internal distributed energy resources to achieve joint electricity and hydrogen output, providing a new pathway for accommodating surplus renewable energy generation. However, precise modeling methods for the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP remain challenging. In this regard, this paper first defines the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP and constructs its internal optimization model. Then, based on multi-parameter programming theory and the cutting-plane method, the mapping relationship of the EH-VPP electricity-hydrogen joint output curve is analytically derived. Based on this, the probability density function of the projection points of the electricity-hydrogen joint curve onto the hydrogen production rate axis is derived, incorporating the known probability distributions of input random variables, thereby enabling probabilistic modeling of the uncertain operating region boundary. Finally, the opportunity constraint method is applied to construct the uncertain operating region of EH-VPP, which is then used in the coordinated scheduling optimization of the electric-hydrogen integrated energy system. Simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently characterizes the uncertain operating region with an error of less than 0.05 %, supports flexible modeling based on confidence levels, and ensures both scheduling security and computational efficiency in large-scale collaborative scheduling scenarios.

AB The hydrogen diffusion behaviors in welded joints of ultra-high strength steel (UHSS), which are related to hydrogen-induced cracks (HIC) in welding, are not yet fully understood due to the lack of in-situ observation techniques for hydrogen during welding. An improved microphotography technique is proposed to visualize the hydrogen distribution within the as-welded joint. When UHSS is welded using traditional welding materials, the transformation temperature from gamma to alpha phase (TF) of the weld metal (WM) is higher than that (TB) of the heataffected zone (HAZ), resulting in the observed hydrogen enrichment in the HAZ. We developed a low transformation temperature (LTT) welding material. This material is designed so that the TF of WM is lower than the TB of HAZ, facilitating hydrogen back-diffusion from the HAZ to the WM. This back-diffusion effectively reduces the hydrogen concentration in the HAZ. Additionally, a thermo-mechanical hydrogen diffusion sequentially coupled finite element procedure was utilized to simulate hydrogen concentration evolution during welding, revealing the control process of phase transformation temperature differences (Delta T = TF - TB) on hydrogen diffusion behavior and the influence of residual stress on the accumulation of hydrogen. The microphotography technique has successfully validated these findings, which can help to mitigate the risk of HIC in the HAZ during welding of UHSS.

AB The port-integrated energy system (PIES) presents a transformative pathway for decarbonizing port operations through multienergy synergies. Power-to-hydrogen technology converts surplus renewable energy into green hydrogen, which is stored and reconverted to electricity via fuel cells during supply shortages. However, joint optimization of heterogeneous ports, with divergent resource endowments and load profiles, remains challenging. This study proposes an optimal scheduling method for electricity-hydrogen-heat-integrated energy systems accounting for port-specific energy characteristics and establishes a multienergy coupling model of PIES with vessel-based mobile hydrogen storage and a cooperative optimization framework incorporating energy consumption dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that multiport joint dispatch reduces total operating costs by 2.3%-8.2%, compared to isolated schemes, while hydrogen-powered vessels enable spatiotemporal arbitrage and serve dual roles as mobile energy carriers/temporary storage units, with hydrogen interchange critically constrained by vessel logistics scheduling.

AB This work evaluates the AWS ER80S-G filler metal in buttery welding and F22 steel joint, in technical and economic replacement of ERNiCrMo-3 wire (Inconel 625). The metallurgical and mechanical characterization of buttery weld interfaces was performed using optical microscopy and scanning microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy and microhardness. The joints fracture toughness was estimated by crack tip opening displacement test and the fracture mechanism by SEM. To evaluate hydrogen embrittlement, samples were hydrogenated with a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution and tested by uniaxial tensile test. The microstructural results revealed that ER80S-G interface did not present any partially mixed zone (PMZ), differently the Inconel 625 interface. The PMZs presence in F22/Inconel 625 interface did not reduce the welded joint toughness. The hydrogen presence in the welded joints reduced the ductility and mechanical strength of F22 steel, in addition to changing the ductile fracture mode to brittle mode.

AB This article is devoted to the following issues: calculating the values of temperatures obtained by simulating welding heating and the subsequent implementation of the welding process at the given mode parameters made it possible to obtain a welded joint of the rotor with an improved initial structure and increased mechanical properties, hydrogen resistance and durability by up to 10-15%; simulating welding heating in the areas of fusion, the overheating and normalization of the HAZ and the formation of austenite grains; specified welding heating creates the conditions for the formation of new products of austenite decomposition in the form of sorbitol in the area of the incomplete recrystallization of the HAZ. In air and gaseous hydrogen, the destruction of the combined joints took place on the weld metal, as well as on the fusion areas, the overheating and the incomplete recrystallization of the HAZ of 20H3NMFA steel as the base metal. Structural materials have a relatively low strength and high fracture toughness in air. This is manifested in a significant reduction in the elongation (delta), the area (psi) and critical stress intensity factor (K-Ic) of welded joints and the endurance limit of cylindrical smooth rotor steel specimens, which were cut from transverse templates. Welded joints in the whole range of load amplitudes are sensitive to the action of hydrogen.

AB One of the major challenges for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) with therapeutic drugs is the short half-life of drugs in the joint cavity. The severity of OA often fluctuates with time and inflammatory factors. Here, we describe the use of a hydrogel material, named Gel-Man, to solve the problem of rapid release of drugs. Gel-Man could encapsulate a series of therapeutic drugs and be degraded by hydrogen peroxide. It could be decomposed, and release drugs controlled by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the arthritic joint cavity. This hydrogel loaded with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) could slowly release the drug upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide in the joint cavity in patients suffering from osteoarthritis. The combination of TA and GEL-MAN hydrogels can slowdown the progression of degenerative change of osteoarthritis by maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and prolong the duration of drug treatment.

AB Effects of reducing environment and thermal aging on the joint strength of a BaO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic sealant (GC-9) with a ferritic-stainless-steel interconnect (Crofer 22 H) for planar solid oxide fuel cells are investigated. A technique is developed for conducting mechanical tests at room temperature and 800 degrees C in H-2-7 vol% H2O under shear and tensile loadings. Given an aged condition and loading mode, the joint strength at 800 degrees C is lower than that at room temperature in the given humidified hydrogen atmosphere. A thermal aging at 800 degrees C in H-2-7 vol% H2O for 100 h or 1000 h enhances both shear and tensile joint strengths at room temperature but degrades them at 800 degrees C in the same reducing environment Non-aged specimens show a comparable joint strength and fracture mode when tested in humidified hydrogen and in air under a given loading mode and testing temperature. The shear strength at 800 degrees C for joint specimens after a 1000-h thermal aging at 800 degrees C in air or humidified hydrogen is reduced by a similar extent of 19%, compared to the counterpart of non-aged joint specimens tested in the same oxidizing or reducing environment.

AB Neutron diffraction studies of hydrogen/deuterium-exchanged hen egg-white lysozyme were performed by a joint X-ray and neutron refinement to elucidate the hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior. Large crystals for neutron work, consisting of molecules that were exchanged before crystallization, were obtained by repeatedly adding protein solution to the crystal batch using deuterated precipitant reagent. There are differences in hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior compared with previous crystallographic or NMR studies, which could be due to intermolecular interactions in the crystal or to different lengths of exchange period.

AB Blending a fraction of hydrogen into the natural gas pipeline or urban pipe network is an efficient approach for hydrogen delivery. In this paper, the mathematical model of Hydrogen-Blended Natural Gas (HBNG) transportation is established, and the influences of hydrogen blending on hydraulic and thermal characteristics of natural gas pipeline and pipe network are numerically investigated. The impact of hydrogen blending ratio on the performance of centrifugal compressor and the operating point for joint operation of pipeline and compressor is discussed. Results illustrate that compared with natural gas without hydrogen, the hydrogen blending can reduce the pipeline friction resistance and increase the volume flow rate. However, due to the lower volumetric calorific value of HBNG, the energy flow rate actually decreases under the same transportation condition. Meanwhile, the temperature drop along the pipeline slows down due to the blended hydrogen. The performance degradation of centrifugal compressor occurs with the increasing hydrogen blending ratio, and the operating point for joint operation of pipeline and centrifugal compressor moves to the direction of higher volume flow rate and lower pressure. This study is expected to shed a light on the hydrogen delivery by natural gas pipelines and pipe networks.

AB The introduction of hydrogen into the UK natural gas main has been reviewed in terms of how materials within the gas distribution network may be affected by contact with up to 80% Natural Gas (NG)/20 mol% hydrogen blend at up to 2 barg. A range of metallic, polymeric and elastomeric materials in the gas distribution network (GDN) were assessed via a combination of literature review and targeted practical test programmes. The work considered: ? The effect of hydrogen on metallic materials identified in the network. ? The effect of hydrogen on polymeric materials identified in the network. ? The effect of hydrogen exposure on polyethylene pipeline joining and repair techniques (squeeze-off, and socket and saddle electrofusion joints) The experimental work involved soaking materials, under pressure conditions representative of the network, in 100% hydrogen, 20% hydrogen in methane, and 100% methane. For the metal samples, the test programme involved the assessment of hydrogen uptake on the tensile properties. For the polyethylene samples, the test programme looked at the assessment of possible hydrogen absorption/desorption and its effect on electrofusion jointing. The trials concluded that the majority of metallic materials showed no significant deterioration in mechanical (tensile) properties when stored in hydrogen environments compared to those stored in analogous methane or blended gas atmospheres up to 2 barg. Polymeric materials showed no deterioration to efficiency of squeeze-off or collar electrofusion in socket or shoulder orientations following soaking in hydrogen, methane or hydrogen blends. ? 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The susceptibility of girth welds to sulphide stress cracking (SSC) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) were evaluated for API grade X80 and X56 steels, both for similar (X80/X80) and dissimilar (X80/X56) joints. Slow strain rate (SSR) and hydrogen permeation tests were performed at room temperature using sodium thiosulphate solutions at different pH levels. The SSR tests showed that the majority of the welded joints studied, though approved by the API 1104 standard's criteria, did in fact suffer a reduction in ductility and showed indications of susceptibility to sulphide stress cracking and to hydrogen embrittlement in the form of secondary longitudinal and internal transverse cracks. This was true regardless the welding process used.

AB This work is aiming at investigation on Hydrogen impact on welded cold cracks in titanium weldments. The results indicated that when the hydrogen content in titanium alloy is below 300 ppm, the difficulty of delayed cracking in welded joints is relatively high. With the increase of hydrogen content, the tendency of delayed cracking increases, and the fracture mode changes from ductile fracture to brittle fracture, the amount of primary alpha phase in the alloy decreases and eventually disappears, while the amount of beta transition microstructure gradually increases with more acicular alpha ' phase and delta hydride. The delayed cracking at the weld toe position of the joint is related to high residual stress and the enrichment of hydrogen elements. The influence of hydrogen content on the delay of cold crack was analyzed, the mechanism of delayed cold crack generation was discussed. A model for the critical hydrogen content that causes welding cold cracks due to the coupling of welding stress and hydrogen was constructed, the coupling mechanism of welding stress and hydrogen content was clarified, and the influence of the two on the cold crack of titanium alloy welding was revealed.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Resistance of welded joint of X70 steel welded using Sv-08G1NMA and OK 10-74 flux wire against stress-corrosion cracking in near-neutral pH solution NS4 was investigated by the slow-strain rate method, voltammetry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electrolytic permeation of hydrogen method. It was established that the stress-corrosion cracking of welded joint occurs through the base metal in the range of potentials more positive than -0.92 V by the anodic dissolution mechanism, more negative than -1.05 V is consistent with a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism, and in the potentials' range from -0.92 V to -1.05 V, both by anodic dissolution and a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism. The susceptibility to stress-corrosion cracking coefficient KS increases with the polarization potential shift -0.75 V - -0.95 V - -1.05 V as follows: for the welded joint as 1.1 - 1.16 - 1.35, for X70 steel as 1.0 - 1.12 - 1.0.

AB The short-term stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of X65 pipeline steel welded joints in simulated deep (1000 m) and shallow sea was studied by the immersion of U-shaped bend samples, electrochemistry, and scanning electron microscope observation of fracture surfaces. Results showed that a crack existed near the fusion line in deep sea, whereas no crack occurred in shallow sea. Tafel slope and corrosion potential of welded joint was low in deep sea environment indicting there excited hydrogen evolution reactions. Cathodic polarization was controlled by both oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions in deep sea, but only oxygen reduction reactions in shallow sea. The sensitivity of the SCC of the welded joint in deep sea was higher than that in shallow sea.

AB To identify the safety issues associated with hydrogen fueling stations, incidents at such stations in Japan and the USA were analyzed considering the regulations in these countries. Leakage due to the damage and fracture of main bodies of apparatuses and pipes in Japan and the USA is mainly caused by design error, that is, poorly planned fatigue. Considering the present incidents in these countries, adequate consideration of the usage environment in the design is very important. Leakage from flanges, valves, and seals in Japan is mainly caused by screw joints. If welded joints are to be used in hydrogen fueling stations in Japan, strength data for welded parts should be obtained and pipe thicknesses should be reduced. Leakage due to other factors, e.g., external impact, in Japan and the USA is mainly caused by human error. To realize self-serviced hydrogen fueling stations, safety measures should be developed to prevent human error by fuel cell vehicle users. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Bonding at high temperatures can cause many problems, such as an induction of high stress, grain coarsening and strict requirements for bonding equipments, etc.. In this paper, a hydrogenation approach was utilized for the TC4 alloy before the dissimilar materials bonding process. Effects of hydrogen contents on the diffusion behavior of the TC4/GH3128 joints were investigated. Particularly, the mechanism that the hydrogenation affected the low-temperature bonding process of the TC4/GH3128 joints was discussed. By regulating the bonding temperatures, holding durations and hydrogen contents, a maximum of 92 MPa was achieved. The formation mechanism of the diffusion bonded TC4/GH3128 joint was proposed. This novel metal hydrogenation idea can offer new insights on the development of the low-temperature joining particularly suitable for dissimilar materials joining.

AB Sulfide stress cracking resistance of welded high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel for high pressure vessel (called "WDL690D" steel) was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature. Though the failure time increased with the decreasing applied stress for either WDL690D base steel or its welded joint, the welded joint presented the lower threshold stress of about 53% YS compared with the base steel of about 65% YS, because of its inhomogeneous microstructure distribution. The hydrogen trapping efficiency of the WDL6900 base steel and its welded joint was also investigated by measuring the permeability 1,0I. and the apparent diffusivity (Dapp). The results showed that the welded joint had lower trapping efficiency, but was more susceptible to SSC. In addition, the fractography of both the WDL690D base steel and its welded joint all exhibited a mixed ductile-brittle rupture when exposed in H2S environment under constant loading stress.

AB Hydrogenation can adjust the microstructure state of Ti-6Al-4V laser weld joint, and improve the superplastic deformation uniformity. The study on superplastic deformation behavior of hydrogenated Ti-6Al-4V laser weld joint is the basis of the improvement of the superplastic deformation uniformity. Therefore, the present paper investigated the effect of the set hydrogen amount on the peak flow stress, welded plate elongation and microstructure uniformity. The results reveal that the peak flow stress increases with the rising hydrogen content, decreases with the higher deformation temperature, and increases with the increasing of strain rate. The elongation declines when the hydrogen content increases, improves when the deformation temperature rises, and decreases when the strain rate increases. The minimum peak flow stress is 20.7 MPa, and the maximum elongation reaches 312% when the hydrogen content is 0.291%, the deformation temperature 920 degrees C and the strain rate 10(-4) s(-1).

AB Schedulable hydropower and hydrogen power provide essential flexibility to mitigate variability of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic power. Previous research has focused on the flexibility of power systems utilizing a single adjustable source (e.g., hydropower). However, joint flexibility of combining adjustable hydropower and hydrogen power has rarely been explored simultaneously. This study aims to establish a joint flexible operation framework for hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power systems. Initially, the forecast uncertainties are quantified regarding the inflow as well as the combined wind and photovoltaic power. Subsequently, a triobjective optimization model is formulated to maximize operation benefits while enhancing joint flexibility in managing water levels and allocating power to hydrogen production, deriving the flexible operation space. Finally, the operation space's effectiveness is validated by stochastic simulation. Results from a case study using China's Ertan hydro-hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic hybrid power system indicated that the minimum operation benefit derived from the decisions within the operation space decreased with increasing flexibilities of both the water level and power allocation to hydrogen production. The benefit loss (i.e., the gap between the theoretical maximum and actual benefits) decreased by 26.53 %, from 3.77 to 2.77 million CNY, through maintaining operation decisions within the flexible space during a hypothetical earthquake emergency. This was achieved by adjusting 1.79 % release and 10.71 % hydrogen production power. The proposed method provides implications of jointly utilizing flexibilities of adjustable power sources to decrease economic loss. This research contributes to reducing energy emissions by improving energy use efficiency of power systems.

AB P91 steel weld joint was prepared using the shielded metal arc welding process and four different conditions of weld consumable that provide the different levels of diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal. In the present research, the effects of diffusible hydrogen content on the flexural strength, lower critical stress, and tensile strength of P91 steel welds were also determined with respect to different electrode conditions. To investigate the effect of diffusible hydrogen on multipass welding, top and root side flexural tests were performed. The residual stresses (axial stress and transverse stress) were also measured using the blind hole drilling method for different conditions of welding consumable. The peak value of residual stresses was measured at the center of the weld fusion zone. The maximum value of transverse stress was measured to be 355 MPa for case II (6.21 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen), while the maximum axial stress was about 218 MPa for case IV (12.43 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen). A three-dimensional finite element simulation was also performed to predict the residual stress distribution and thermal profile along the welded joint. The experimentally determined residual stresses correlated well with the numerically estimated residual stresses. The diffusible hydrogen content was not observed to have any significant effect on the residual stresses. The corrected residual stress values were also predicted by considering the plasticity-induced error. However, the flexural performance of the welded joint was affected by the diffusible hydrogen content. The top and root flexural strength was measured to be optimum for the low level of diffusible hydrogen content, and the values decreased with an increase in diffusible hydrogen content.

AB In this work, AlSi10MgMn die cast aluminum alloy and 6061 aluminum alloys were bonded using Metal inert gas (MIG) welding assisted by ultrasonic frequency pulse (UFP). The effect of UFP on the weld shape, joint porosity, microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints was investigated. Results revealed a distinct decrease in joint hydrogen porosity defects and pore size via the UFP-MIG welding approach in comparison to a directly bonded joint. This method resulted in the tensile strength of the joint reaching 185% of the joint bonded without UFP. The regulating mechanism of UFP on the joint porosity was determined.

AB Fatigue crack growth behavior of the hydrogenated Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy gas tungsten arc welded (GTAW) joints was investigated. Fracture model of hydrogen-induced GTAW joint was revealed in details. The results show that as hydrogen level increased, crack growth rate in Paris and instability growth zones increased, the more the hydride, the more crack growth channels, the faster crack growth rate, and brittle fracture was intensified. There was the mutation of dislocation density on both sides of the hydride, and dislocation tangles and dislocation lines were concentrated in the vicinity of the hydride. Dislocation weakening caused by solute hydrogen and internal stress generated by hydrogen-rich clusters respectively promoted crack initiation. Evolution of hydride morphology and distribution caused by the interaction between the hydride and persistent slip bands (PSB) significantly reduced crack initiation resistance. Hydride inside the PSB as a hardening phase accelerated to separate from the matrix or itself fracture, which further promoted crack initiation. Cracks in Paris zone rapidly propagated along grain boundary of coarse size "cluster", alpha / beta phase boundary and the hydride, or cut through alternating lamellar alpha and fine needle beta grains and the hydride.

AB Large-scale green hydrogen production system combining wind farms and electrolysis systems is an important way to low-carbon energy system. The flexible and fast ramping capability of the electrolysis system provides the possibility for a wind-electrolysis joint system (WEJS) to provide secondary frequency regulation (SFR) to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen. To increase the biddable capacity and improve the full load hours, this paper proposes a cooperative power allocation strategy for wind turbines and electrolyzers responding to the down and up AGC signals respectively. Furthermore, this paper proposes a more accurate method for estimating the daily hydrogen production due to response to the up ramping of automatic generation control (AGC) signals to ensure that the joint system meets the hydrogen production contract when providing SFR. Based on the above two points, this paper proposes a multi-timescale control framework and robust bidding optimization for a WEJS participating in energy and regulation markets. Case studies demonstrate that the relative error of daily hydrogen production can be controlled at 3.37%. The full load hours of the electrolysis systems can be increased by 50.21% compared with only participation in the energy market.

AB Hydrogen storage cylinder is an important component in high-pressure gaseous hydrogen (HPGH2) storage system, and plays a key role in hydrogen-powered transportation including land vehicles, ships and aircrafts. Over the past decade, the number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) has rapidly increased worldwide. In order to promote the application of hydrogen storage cylinder, guide its design, manufacture, inspection and testing, a series of regulations, codes and standards have been issued. The Chinese national standard, GB/T 42612, for type IV hydrogen storage cylinders has also been issued. This paper first gives a brief overview to these regulations, codes and standards. Furthermore, the specifications including scope, category, filling cycles, service life, materials, design, manufacture, qualification tests and periodic inspections are analyzed and compared. Issues about evaluation method for hydrogen compatibility of non-metallic materials, welded joints of plastic liner, joint between boss and liner are also discussed. Notably, the performance requirements in GB/T 42612 are generally in accordance with the international ones, but the requirements of materials, design and manufacture are more detailed.

AB As an emerging energy carrier, hydrogen presents a potential opportunity to increase the flexibility and resiliency of the integrated power and transportation system having ultrahigh penetration of renewable generation. This article studies a conceptual integrated energy-mobility system (IEMS) based on renewable-to-hydrogen stations (RHSs) and tank truck fleets. In an RHS, the renewables power the grid while also charge a hydrogen energy storage unit that can perform power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P) operations. Besides, using tank truck fleets, the RHS will distribute its surplus hydrogen products to local consumers, e.g., refueling stations serving hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The operation framework of the IEMS is analyzed. And some preprocessing technologies are developed to reduce modeling complexity. Then, a joint optimal scheduling model, involving renewable generationcontract, P2H, and H2P of the RHS, hydrogen product demands of the local consumers, and vehicle routing problem (VRP) of the truck fleets, is established. Afterwards, the formulated problem is solved by a heuristic method based on the exhaustive search and genetic algorithm. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the joint optimal scheduling model and illustrate that the IEMS has the potentials to promote hydrogen-integrated transportation and power systems.

AB Hydrogen produced by water decomposition caused high diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, but also produced numerous spatter and unstable fragments which were considered as the main reason that deteriorated the weld formation during underwater wet flux cored welding (FCAW). Drawn inspiration from onshore gas shielded welding, in this paper, a liquid shielded welding method was invented. As a by-product of biodiesel, glycerol was chosen as liquid protectant. The results suggested that the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal was reduced by 62.4% with glycerol shielded due to its higher decomposition threshold and less hydrogen in decomposition products. Arc bubbles were attached to the molten pool surface and their expansion rate and rising velocity were slowed down resulted in more stable droplet transfer process and less spatter owing to high viscosity glycerol protectant. Almost porosity-free joints were obtained and the mechanical properties of the welded joints were also improved. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Commonly available hydrophobic substances used in industrial applications were selected for the research. The aim of using waterproof coatings was to check the possibility to decreasing the susceptibility of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel to cold cracking. During experiments diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal determination by mercury method, metallographic macro- and microscopic testing and hardness measurements were performed. Investigations showed that waterproof coatings laid on covered electrodes can improve the quality of wet welded joints, by decreasing the Vickers HV10 hardness in heat-affected zone and decreasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, which minimalize possibility of cold cracking.

AB In this paper Small Punch Tests (SPT) are used to determine the mechanical properties of the heat affected zone (HAZ) of CrMoV welded joints and to evaluate the embrittlement caused by the presence of internal hydrogen. Hydrogen permeation tests were carried out to determine the effective diffusion coefficients of the different regions of welded joints, whose hydrogen contents were measured using a hydrogen analyser.
   The paper demonstrates that SPTs can be used to estimate the tensile properties and the toughness of small areas, such as the subzones of a welded joint which are not thick enough for machining standard specimens. In cases where it is not possible to determine the fracture toughness of brittle regions using standard SPT samples, tests using longitudinally notched SPT samples were conducted. The normalized energy at failure, W/t(2), was selected as the most appropriate SPT parameter to estimate the fracture toughness regardless of the fracture behaviour of the material (ductile or brittle). It was seen that the fracture toughness of the fine grained HAZ (FG-HAZ) is similar to that of the Base Metal (BM), while the fracture toughness of the coarse grained HAZ (CG-HAZ) is more similar to that of the Weld Metal (WM). The effect of hydrogen on BM and FG-HAZ is low, with embrittlement indexes of about 20%. However, a strong effect of hydrogen was observed in CG-HAZs and WMs, with embrittlement indexes of 60-80%. and a clear change from ductile to brittle behaviour in their fracture surfaces.

AB Background Hydrogen peroxide has been widely used in Orthopaedics including Orthopaedic oncology, trauma and joint surgeries. However, we encountered an oxygen embolism and myoglobinuria after hydrogen peroxide was used to irrigate a septic hip arthroscopically. Case presentation A 61-year-old male patient with right hip septic arthritis underwent an arthroscopic hip washout and debridement. During the operation, the surgeon used 100 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide to irrigate the joint cavity. Two minutes after irrigation, there was a transient decrease in oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure, with significant subcutaneous emphysema around the wound. Concentrated urine was drained out 8 h after operation which resolved the following day. Post-operatively, the patient was managed in the intensive care unit for a pulmonary embolism and discharged without further complications. Conclusion Medical staff should be aware of the risk of oxygen embolism and be extremely careful when using hydrogen peroxide in patient care. Oxygen embolism following hydrogen peroxide use is rare, however, once encountered, it may bring serious consequences. Therefore, the use of hydrogen peroxide in closed spaces or arthroscopic procedures should be discontinued.

AB X80 steel plays a pivotal role in the development of oil and gas pipelines; however, its welded joints, particularly the heat-affected zone (HAZ), are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) due to their complex microstructures. This study investigates the SCC initiation mechanisms of X80 steel welded joints under practical pipeline conditions with varying levels of cathodic protection. The SCC behaviors were analyzed through electrochemical measurements, hydrogen permeation tests, and interrupted slow strain rate tensile tests (SSRTs) conducted in a near-neutral pH environment under different potential conditions (OCP, -1.1 VSCE, -1.2 VSCE). These behaviors were influenced by microstructure type, grain size, martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents, and dislocation density. The sub-zones of the weld exhibited differing SCC resistance, with the fine-grain (FG) HAZ, base metal (zone), welded metal (WM) zone, and coarse-grain (CG) HAZ in descending order. In particular, the presence of coarse grains, low dislocation density, and extensive M/A islands collectively increased corrosion susceptibility and SCC sensitivity in the CGHAZ compared to other sub-zones. The SCC initiation mechanisms of the sub-zones within the X80-steel welded joint were primarily anodic dissolution (AD) under open-circuit potential (OCP) condition, shifting to either hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity (HELP) or hydrogen embrittlement (HE) mechanisms at -1.1 VSCE or -1.2 VSCE, respectively.

AB Local hydrogen enrichment would increase the risk of hydrogen embrittlement in welded structures, so the dynamic hydrogen diffusion process and final concentration distribution were investigated numerically by finite element simulation for a hydrogen gas transport X80 steel spiral welded pipe. The results show that the change of microstructure induced by weld thermal cycle would decrease the hydrogen concentration in welded joint, but welding residual stress could cause local hydrogen enrichment. Equivalent hydrogen pressures for base metal, weld metal and three subregions in heat-affected zone were put forward in order to scientifically evaluate the influence of hydrogen enrichment on hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Hydrogenation of niobium foil was achieved by cathodic charging and its application as the interlayer facilitates a sound joint of TiA/Ti2AlNb. The microstructure and mechanical properties of hydrogenated niobium were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nano-indentation and thermogravimetry (TG) analysis. It is demonstrated that the plasticity of the surface of niobium interlayer is improved and dislocation density in niobium crystal lattice increases significantly, owing to the process of niobium interlayer hydrogenation and subsequent dehydrogenation. To investigate the effect of the hydrogenation of the niobium interlayer on the TiAl/Ti2AlNb diffusion bonding joint, the pure niobium foil was also applied as the interlayer for comparison. The effect of the bonding parameters on the interfacial microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the joints were systematically analyzed by SEM coupled with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and shear test. The typical microstructure of the joint is found to be TiAl/B2 phase/Nb/delta phase/beta phase/Ti2AlNb. With the increase of the hydrogen content, bonding temperature, holding time and bonding pressure, the bonding defects decreased and the thickness of the diffusion layer increased correspondingly. The shear strength of joint reached 258.9 MPa at 950 degrees C for 40 min under a pressure of 5 MPa with the hydrogenated niobium interlayer of 1.0 wt% hydrogen content.

AB Friction stir welding (FSW) has emerged as a solid-state joining technique offering notable advantages over traditional welding methods. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), a fusion-based process, remains widely used due to its high efficiency, productivity, weld quality, and ease of automation. To combine the benefits of both techniques, a hybrid welding approach integrating GMAW and FSW has been developed. This study investigates the impact of this hybrid technique on the joint quality and properties of AA5083-H111 and AA6082-T6 aluminum alloys. Butt joints were produced on 6 mm thick plates, with variations in friction process parameters. Characterization included macro- and microstructural analyses, mechanical testing (hardness and tensile strength), and corrosion resistance evaluation through stress corrosion cracking tests. Results showed that FSW significantly refined and homogenized the microstructure in both alloys. AA5083-H111 welds achieved a joint efficiency of 99%, while AA6082-T6 reached 66.7%, differences attributed to their distinct strengthening mechanisms and the thermal-mechanical effects of FSW. To assess hydrogen-related behavior, slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests were conducted in both inert and hydrogen-rich environments. Hydrogen content was measured in arc, friction, and overlap zones, revealing variations depending on the alloy and microstructure. Despite these differences, both alloys exhibited negligible hydrogen embrittlement. In conclusion, the GMAW-FSW hybrid process successfully produced sound joints with good mechanical and corrosion resistance performance in both aluminum alloys. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid welding as a viable method for enhancing weld quality and performance in applications involving dissimilar aluminum alloys.

AB The expansion of the gas pipeline network makes it necessary, on the one hand, to meet the requirements of standards regarding the materials used, but on the other hand, it is necessary to weld them. In the case of natural gas as a fuel, the welding process is widely used, but in the case of replacing natural gas with a mixture of this gas and hydrogen, the requirements regarding the quality of the process must be significantly increased or the process must be completely changed. This article presents the results of testing welded joints for a newly developed welding technology for the transmission of a hydrogen mixture. Material tests were carried out on a butt-circumferential-welded joint made between two spiral pipes with an outer diameter of 711 mm and wall thickness of 11 mm in the X70 grade. The developed welding technology is distinguished by a change in the beveling method of the edges, which allows the heat input to the material to be limited. The technology was developed for use in natural on-shore and off-shore gas pipelines with the addition of hydrogen. As a result, additional requirements in terms of joint plasticity had to be met during welding. The test results obtained indicate that the joints are characterized by high strength (more than 581 MPa), higher than that of the base material (fracture in the base material) and good impact strength at reduced temperature (more than 129 J). In transverse corrosion, a hardness below 250 HV and a favorable structure of ferrite with different morphologies were obtained.

AB High-efficiency and energy-saving comprehensive energy systems can provide both economic and environmental benefits. These are crucial for promoting the economy of distribution-network systems. A distributionally robust optimization model is proposed to jointly operate integrated energy systems with wind, hydrogen, cogeneration, combined heat and power (CHP), and other agents, which considers joint demand response and energy sharing across agents. A profit distribution mechanism based on an improved Shapley value is proposed for equally redistributing excessive income. The simulation results show that: (1) the combined wind hydrogen cogeneration-generation (IDR) system reduces hydrogen energy extraction expenses and improves renewable energy utilization efficiency; (2) in line with distributionally robust optimization theory, the optimization model of a wind hydrogen cogeneration direct-drive integrated system for maximizing joint income solves uncertain renewable energy outputs, such as wind energy and photovoltaics, improving the overall benefit of wind hydrogen combined heat and power generation systems; and (3) the improved Shapley value approach solves the income distribution problem for relevant stakeholders, and a reasonable distribution of additional income increases the enthusiasm of all participants.

AB This study examines the influence of arc pulsation and ErNiCrMo-3 filler metal on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in P91 steel weld joints using activated tungsten inert gas (A-TIG) welding. The constant current joint without filler showed the lowest resistance to SCC, while the pulsed current joint with filler exhibited the highest SCC resistance. Arc pulsation reduced chromium carbide precipitates, enhancing microstructural refinement and crack growth thereby increasing tensile strength and SCC resistance. Filler introduced minor austenitic phases inside martensitic microstructure with reduced hydrogen content contributed to increased SCC resistance. The joint fractography among all welds revealed a complete transgranular fracture.

AB The sulphide stress cracking (SSC) behaviour of the dissimilar metal welded joint of X60 pipeline steel and Inconel 625 alloy in H2S environment was investigated using constant load testing, weight loss.testing and finite element analysis. The dissimilar welded joint shows high SSC susceptibility, and the asymmetric stress concentration after corrosion is the prerequisite for crack initiation. Anodic dissolution prevents crack blunting, whereas hydrogen embrittlement increases the crack propagation rate and affects SSC to propagate along the fusion boundary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study looks at the confinement effects of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and magnetic fields, as well as topological defects in a quantum plasma, on the hydrogen atom. The joint effects show that the system is extremely attractive. Furthermore, as we have shown, the joint effect of the fields is greater than the sum of the individual effects, resulting in a significant change in the system's bound state energy. The magnetic field can be used as a control parameter or booster, whereas the topological defect and the AB field are needed to hold the hydrogen atom in quantum plasmas at a low energy. The findings of our research may be extended to atomic structure and plasma collisions.

AB It is rather difficult for Ti alloy welds to be superplastic formed due to their low superplasticity and high flow stress. In this study, the Ti-6Al-4V alloy after hydrogenation with 0.2 wt% hydrogen was subjected to friction stir welding (FSW). The superplastic behavior of the FSW joint was investigated. The stir zone with a fine lamellar microstructure exhibited a largest elongation of 660% at 825 degrees C and 3 x 10(-3) s(-1). Besides, the stir zone showed a similar superplasticity of close to 600% to the base material at 825 degrees C, 3 x 10(-4) -1 x 10(-3) s(-1). It is the first report on the superplasticity of FSW Ti alloy joints with hydrogenation. Compared to the FSW Ti-6Al-4V alloy joint without hydrogenation, the hydrogenated FSW joint showed superior superplastic properties, including a high elongation, less than a half flow stress and lower superplastic temperature. These superior superplastic properties were mainly attributed to the globularization of the lamellar microstructure and the high fraction of beta phase induced by the hydrogen element. This study provides an effective way to reduce the difficulty of practical superplastic forming for Ti alloy welds, although a dehydrogenation process is still needed to avoid hydrogen embrittlement.

AB In this paper, the mechanical properties of various zones of the welded joints of a heat-resistant steel 15Kh1M1F in different states (in the initial state, after an operation on the main steam piping of a thermal power plant (TPP) for 23 years) were determined, and the fracture surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The effect of hydrogen electrolytic charging on mechanical behavior and fracture mechanism was also studied. The long-term operation of welds resulted in a higher degradation degree of the weld metal compared to the base one, indicated by the deterioration of mechanical properties: decrease in hardness, strength characteristics, and reduction in area, which was accompanied by an atypical increase in elongation at fracture. All studied zones of the operated welded joints were characterized by higher hydrogen content, 2.5-3 times higher than that in the initial state. Additional hydrogen charging of the weld joint metal led to a decrease in the strength and ductility characteristics, more significantly for the operated weld compared with the non-operated one. This justified the possibility of using short-term tests of hydrogenated WM in the air to assess the degree of its damage during operation on a steam piping.

In recent years, the developments of low hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF) consumables that contain no hygroscopic compounds are utilized for welding Q&T steels. Heat affected zone (HAZ) softening is another critical issue during welding of armour grade Q&T steels and it depends on the welding process employed and the weld thermal cycle. In this investigation an attempt has been made to study the influence of welding consumables and welding processes on metallurgical characteristics of armour grade Q&T steel joints by various metallurgical characterization procedures. Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) processes were used for making welds using ASS, LHF and HNS welding consumables. The joints fabricated by using LHF consumables offered lower degree of HAZ softening and there is no evidence of HIC in the joints fabricated using LHF consumables.

AB A computer simulation study of a system containing 33666 SPC/E water molecules at the atmospheric pressure and room temperature is carried out. A thermodynamically motivated geometric criterion of the hydrogen bond is developed based on statistical regularities of joint distributions of oxygen-oxygen, oxygen-hydrogen distances, and the interaction energies of molecular pairs corresponding to these distances. Using this criterion makes it possible to substantially increase the selectivity of the algorithms for identifying hydrogen bonds during computer simulation.

AB Hydrogen-powered vehicles have recently attracted significant attention from both the private sector and the governmental organizations as an alternative to the conventional fossil-fueled vehicles. In addition, the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology now offers a promising solution for the reliable and safe storage of hydrogen. The proliferation of hydrogen-based vehicles depends heavily on the economic viability of the LOHC-based hydrogen generation and storage plants. This paper demonstrates how such plants should be sized and operated for joint applications, in order to enhance the system rate of return. To that end, a new model is proposed for optimal sizing and scheduling of the LOHC-based generation and storage plants for concurrent services to both the transportation sector and ancillary services market. The ancillary service signals are incorporated into the optimal scheduling model, in order to prepare the LOHC-based plant for the successful contribution to the market. The efficacy of the model is numerically evaluated using historical operating data, and the results are discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed model can alleviate the gap between the present and the expected rate of return of the LOHC-based plants via joint scheduling for multiple services.

AB To analyze the causes and mechanisms affecting the fracture toughness of X80 pipeline steel welded joints against H2S, the fracture toughness of different zones of X80 pipeline steel welded joints in both air and saturated H2S solution was investigated. The fracture toughness of welded joints degraded significantly in the saturated H2S solution, where the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) characteristic value in the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) and weld metal (WM) was only 8% and 12% of that in air, respectively. However, the sub-critical grain heat-affected zone (SCHAZ) showed better resistance to H2S corrosion, with the CTOD characteristic value reaching 42% of that in air. The resistance of the welded joint to H2S corrosion was sensitive to microstructures. The grain boundary ferrite (GBF) presented in WM, and the angle of grain boundary orientation in CGHAZ was not conducive to hindering crack propagation. Moreover, the formation of the resultant hydrogen cracks owing to the H2S corrosion also reduced the fracture toughness of the welded joint.

AB Using basic-type flux cored wires significantly improve the toughness of weld joints, but the addition of fluoride decreases the weld-ability of the metal. In this paper, the flux cored tungsten inert gas (FCTIG) process was used to weld DH36 steel with a basic-type flux cored wire and a rutile-type flux cored wire. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the wires were investigated as well as the diffusible hydrogen content in the different weld joints. The results indicated that the FCTIG process using a basic-type flux cored wire has more technological advantages and produces lower amounts of fume during welding compared with flux cored arc welding (FCAW). The presence of large amounts of alloying elements in the rutile-type flux cored wire promoted the formation of acicular ferrite (AF) in the weld bead, which enhanced the micro-hardness and strength of the bead. The generation of fluoride with the basic-type flux cored wire reduced the diffusible hydrogen content (DHC) in the weld joint, with the lowest DHC value being 3.18 mL/100 g. The toughness of the weld joint made with the basic-type flux cored wire was improved, and the highest impact energy measured was 264.8 J.

AB Hydrogen provides a pathway to the clean transition of the future energy mix, rendering hydrogen energy service providers (HESPs) an important role in hydrogen supply. Additionally, collaborative operation through vehicle based hydrogen transportation exhibits great potential for mitigating source-load fluctuations of HESPs. However, current collaborations on hydrogen transportation primarily focus on route selection while neglecting delay risks, which may precipitate abrupt energy deficits during the scheduling of energy receivers. This work proposes a multi-HESP cooperative game that considers a deadline assignment mechanism to ensure the robustness hydrogen delivery while fully unlocking the scheduling flexibility supported by the road network. Considering the transportation-time uncertainty, the distributionally robust joint chance constraint (DRJCC) is introduced model delay uncertainties effectively and improve hydrogen delivery reliability. A customized approximation method is proposed to reformulate the DRJCC model into a tractable approximation with low conservatism while enhancing flexibility in decision-making under transportation delay uncertainty. Case studies verify that proposed framework can improve the flexibility and enthusiasm of multi-HESP cooperation under the electricity-hydrogen transmission network.

AB The weldability of steel under the water is limited due to the influence of the environment. Water causes limited visibility, presence of the residual stresses, increasing the cooling rate, and increasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, leading to the formation of brittle microstructures in heat-affected zone (HAZ). The paper presents the results of mechanical properties testing of S420G2+M steel welded joints made with covered electrodes in the water with salinity values: 0 & PTSTHOUSND;, 7.5 & PTSTHOUSND;, and 35 & PTSTHOUSND;. The non-destructive tests: ultrasonic (UT) and radiographic (RT), and destructive tests: Vickers HV10 measurements, Charpy impact, and bending and metallographic macro- and microscopic tests were performed. Moreover, the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal by the mercury method was measured. It was observed that water salinity has an influence on the stability of the welding arc and the properties of joints. In particular, it was found that increasing the water salinity provides to: decreasing the hardness of HAZ (from 211 HV10 to 193 HV10), increasing the impact strength (from 82.5 to 101.3 J/cm(2)). Additionally, a slight increase in the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal (up to 65 ml/100g) was observed. The number of microcracks in the joints decreased with increasing the water salinity.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of high-grade pipeline welded joint is a threat to hydrogen gas transport. In this research, slow strain rate tension (SSRT) tests in high-pressure hydrogen gas, combined with hydrogen permeation tests and microstructure analysis were conducted on X80 steel, intercritical heated-affected zone (ICHAZ), fine-grained heat affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). The change of HE susceptibility from high to low was CGHAZ, FGHAZ, ICHAZ, and base metal. Microstructure was the important factor influencing hydrogen permeation and susceptibility to HE. Susceptibility to HE was increased in the order of "fine-grained massive ferrite (ME) and acicular ferrite (AF)", "fine-grained granular bainite (GB) and MF", "coarse-grained GB and bainite ferrite (BF) embedded with martensite-austenite (M-A) constitute". The fine-grained MF and AF in base metal with lower hydrogen diffusivity can impede the embrittlement behaviour, while the coarse-grained GB and BF with higher hydrogen diffusivity in CGHAZ increased its susceptibility to HE.

AB In the present study, the dissimilar welded joints of AA6082/A360 aluminum alloy were prepared by cold metal transfer (CMT) mode, cold metal transfer with pulse (CMT + Pulse) mode, and pulse (Pulse) mode. The influence of the metal transfer modes on the porosity distribution, microstructure, and mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints were analyzed. The results show that the formation and distribution of weld pores are mainly determined by the hydrogen content of the base metals, cooling rate of the molten pool, driving force, and escaping distance of bubbles. For all the prepared dissimilar welded joints, the regions with the highest porosity appear at the A360 side fusion lines due to the higher hydrogen content of the casting A360 aluminum alloy, followed by the AA6082 side fusion lines and the central regions. With the application of Pulse mode in the welding process, the driving force of bubbles increases and the escape time shortens. The escape time of a bubble was reduced from 4.0 to 3.0 ms compared to CMT welding mode. Therefore, the average porosity of the joints decreases significantly, and the tensile stress increases accordingly. The microstructure of the weld zone gradually changed from long strip grains to equiaxed grains. The tensile stress of the dissimilar welded joint prepared by Pulse mode is 59.2% higher than that of the CMT welded joint.

AB Reliable low-temperature bonding of Zr-4 alloy is crucial for the safe run of nuclear reactors because the high temperature damages the performance of Zr-4 alloy. The hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy containing 0.2 wt % hydrogen was formed by gaseous hydrogen charging at 700 degrees C for 2 h and was subsequently used to facilitate the diffusion bonding of Zr-4 alloy. The effect of hydrogen and bonding temperature (600-700 degrees C) on the microstructure and phase composition were investigated by electro channeling images (ECCI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The repeatable results indicated that, dif-fusion bonding of Zr-4 alloy was successfully realized at low temperature of 650 degrees C for 60 min under a pressure of 15 MPa. The bonding temperature was about 150 degrees C lower than the bonding temperature (800 degrees C) required in bonding of Zr-4 alloy without hydrogen charging treatment. The joint had highest room temperature shear strength was when bonding at 700 degrees C, which increased by 367% relative to the shear strength (55 +/- 7 MPa) of the joint welded without hydrogen charging treatment at same temperature.

AB This study provides a comprehensive review of research on the optimization of location and capacity planning for hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) serving hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). First, we outline HRS components and processes to establish a technical foundation. Then it examines key factors influencing HRS planning and highlights the integration of technical considerations with strategic decisions. We further discuss the singleobjective and multi-objective optimization models, and emphasize their respective application scenarios. The findings suggest that joint optimization of location and capacity can reduce total costs by up to 10-15 %, increase the demand coverage rate to over 90 % and improve the efficiency of urban hydrogen transportation networks, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of urban hydrogen transportation networks. Finally, the review identifies future research directions, including the integration of advanced technologies and policy coordination. Overall, this work offers theoretical insights and practical guidance for HRS planning, supporting the broader development of hydrogen energy infrastructure and contributing to the transition toward sustainable transportation systems.

AB This study investigates the effect of thermal exposure (i.e., 80 degrees C for 14 days) on the static and fatigue characteristics of adhesive-bonded aluminum joints. Results showed that thermal exposure reduced the quasi-static strength of the adhesive-bonded joints by up to similar to 16%. The thermal exposure slightly decreased the fatigue resistance of the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints at high cycle regime (>similar to 10(6) cycles) but significantly degraded the fatigue resistance at low cycle regime (similar to 10(3) - 10(4) cycles). The effects of thermal exposure on the properties of adhesive and interfacial bond adhesion between the adhesive and aluminum were analyzed. It was found that the thermal exposure degraded the properties of adhesive due to that adhesive was oxidized, which led to the decreases of the static strength and fatigue resistance at low cycle regime for the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints. The oxidation of adhesive decreased the content of O-H group in the adhesive, which likely reduced the hydrogen bond at the adhesive/aluminum interface. The decrease in the content of hydrogen bond weakened the bond adhesion at the adhesive/aluminum interface, and consequently slightly reduced the fatigue resistance at high cycle regime for the adhesive-bonded aluminum joints.

AB In this work, the environmental fracture behavior of marine steel and its welding joint were compared in artificial seawater. The electrochemical measurement, slow strain rate tensile test, and low-frequency cyclic loading test were conducted. The results showed that the corrosion current density and stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of welding joints were higher than those of base metal, caused by high dislocation density and residual stress in the heat-affected zone. The acidification and ion concentration occurred at the crack tip of the welding joint and basic metal. pH value and Cl-- concentration at the crack tip reached 4.1 and 3.8 mol/L, respectively. The crack growth rate of the welding joint was higher than that of base metal. The crack growth behavior was controlled by the mechano-electrochemical effect at the crack tip, and hydrogen embrittlement was the main factor.

AB The development of low-Mo austenitic stainless steels for high-pressure hydrogen valves and joints was undertaken to contribute to resource saving. Low-strain-rate tensile tests were carried out at 233 K in 70 MPa high-pressure gaseous hydrogen. The fracture surfaces of specimens tested in high-pressure gaseous hydrogen were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of hydrogen charging on room-temperature creep deformation was studied. The resistance of the specimens to hydrogen gas embrittlement was revealed by the results of the low-strain-rate tensile tests. Specimens that fractured in gaseous hydrogen at 70 MPa in 233 K underwent shear deformation rather than cup-and-cone deformation. A small difference in the creep deformation was recognized between hydrogen-charged and uncharged specimens.

AB Vanadium alloy (V4Cr4Ti) is a structural material used in future fusion reactors owing to its inherent advantages of high -temperature strength and neutron irradiation resistance. Oxygen pickup and high hydrogen isotope permeability are the two major concerns for their application in various types of blankets. To solve these issues, a bimetallic joint was designed with a CLF-1 layer of reduced -activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel to resist corrosion and a CLF-1/V4Cr4Ti bonding interface to suppress hydrogen isotope permeation. Samples were prepared from joints bonded via solid-state diffusion under hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Deuterium (D) gas permeation tests were performed at various temperatures in the range 400 -600 degrees C at 100 kPa. After deuterium permeation tests, the thermal desorption spectra (TDS) of the samples were analyzed. And the permeation behavior of deuterium atom across the joints was schematically discussed. The results showed that bonding with steel could be an effective solution for resisting hydrogen isotope permeation through the V4Cr4Ti alloy. Thermal desorption spectrum (TDS) analysis of the tested samples revealed a desorption peak temperature equivalent to that of TiC. The formation of a 1 pm -wide B2 ordered alpha'- [Fe, (V, Ti)] phase layer, together with a large number of dispersed carbides around the interface, played a significant role in the deuterium permeation resistance. In addition, microstructural changes in the steel base material after the 900 degrees C bonding process were beneficial for suppressing deuterium diffusion.

AB Weld cold cracking is a kind of hydrogen embrittlement and is a serious problem when high strength steel is concerned. Cold cracking usually occurs at the area where hydrogen locally accumulates, and hence hydrogen diffusion modelling is important to understand the hydrogen distribution in a welded joint. In this paper, we conducted the permeation tests to measure the apparent diffusion coefficients of hydrogen with varying the hardness and the plastic strain of the steel. The experimental results were used to develop the empirical equation to predict the diffusion coefficient. The empirical equation is described as a function of temperature, hardness and plastic strain. Next, we measured the evolution curves of hydrogen released from the rectangular specimens. We considered the boundary condition of the surface exposed to the atmosphere, and the experimental results were used to determine the boundary condition. The empirical equation and the boundary condition obtained in this paper will be used for the numerical calculations of hydrogen diffusion in a weld cold cracking test in the companion paper.

AB AIM: To discuss the effects of different concentrations of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an active constituent of Chinese herb, on damaged Shandong human corneal epithelial cell (SDHCEC) induced by hydrogen peroxide.
   METHODS: We detected the combined effects of TMP with concentrations ranging from 4 mg/mL to 0.03 mg/mL and 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide on SDHCEC. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was processed at 3, 6 and 12h separately while the detection of cell apoptosis at 6h only by flow cytometry.
   RESULTS: The viability of SDHCEC with 0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.125 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL TMP joint with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide at 3h and 6h was significantly higher than that with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide only, P<0.05. However, except 0.25 mg/mL, IMP with other concentrations joint with 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide at 12h could not significantly inhibit decreased SDHCEC viability induced by 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide. At 12h, IMP of 0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.125 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL could significantly inhibit SDHCEC early apoptosis induced by 800 mu M hydrogen peroxide, most remarkable at 0.25 mg/mL IMP, P<0.05.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that hydrogen peroxide can induce apoptosis related damage to SDHCEC. IMP can protect SDHCEC from the damage, and the protective effects may be associated with its anti-apoptosis mechanism.

TI Advanced Multi-Step Brazing (AMSB) for fabrication of new type of W/
   stainless steel first-wall component with ODS-Cu intermediate layer
SO FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English

ID FRACTURE-BEHAVIOR; DEFORMATION
AB The novel method "Advanced Multi-Step Brazing (AMSB)" has been developed to fabricate a new type of "divertor" and "first-wall" heat removal component in a fusion reactor. This study is focused on the latter component, in which a tungsten (W) sheet is jointed through AMSB to a stainless steel (SUS) substrate via an oxide dispersion strengthened copper (ODS-Cu) intermediate layer. The principle of AMSB is a repetitive application of the advanced brazing technique (ABT). The initial purpose of the ABT was to braze W to ODS-Cu (GlidCop (R)) with the Ni-11 %P filler material. Later, we confirmed that the ABT is able to produce a very tough GlidCop (R) and SUS (GlidCop (R)/SUS) joint. One of the major advantages of GlidCop (R)/SUS joints is physically strong tolerance against the repetitive brazing heat-cycle. Thus, a repetitive application of the ABT does not cause any negative effects against post-brazed GlidCop (R)/SUS joints, and hence AMSB can be applied for fabricating a single heat-removal component with multiple joint interfaces. A small-scale sample of the new type of first-wall component was fabricated through two-step brazing. At first, the GlidCop (R) plate was jointed to the SUS by the ABT, and then a thin W-sheet with the thickness of 0.254 mm was jointed to GlidCop (R)/SUS by the ABT. If a large area of the first-wall surface in the fusion reactor can be covered with such a thin W-sheet, the amount of hydrogen isotopes trapped on the first-wall surface could be significantly reduced, compared to other fabrication methods such as a vacuum plasma spray W (VPS-W). The VPS-W is theoretically less dense than a Wsheet and often contains pore structures, which could act as effective trapping sites for hydrogen isotopes. A small-scale sample of the new type of first-wall component with a W-sheet (W/GlidCop (R)/SUS) was successfully fabricated to overcome the above disadvantages. In addition, the W surface of the component showed low retention characteristics of hydrogen isotopes compared with other W surfaces, e.g., atmospheric plasma-sprayed W (APS-W).

AB Understanding hydrogen embrittlement in steels requires research in hydrogen diffusion and trapping at microstructural defects. The present paper deals with hydrogen permeation and trapping at defects in the base material, Armco iron, eliminating effects coupled with alloying and precipitation. Cycled permeation curves are recorded and evaluated by using sound diffusion models to identify hydrogen trap sites as dislocations, grain boundaries and vacancies and assign their trapping energies. Furthermore, trap densities are evaluated and used together with the trapping energies as parameters in an adapted diffusion equation for hydrogen, interpreting the experiments significantly better than simple use of classical Fick's laws.

Optical microscope, electron back-scattered diffraction, and X-ray diffraction were applied to analyze the corresponding microstructure changes. The results show that the hydrogen diffusion coefficient D is mainly determined by the final heattreated peak temperature, and the key microstructural affecting factors of hydrogen permeation will change with this temperature. The order of D from high to low is acicular ferrite, granular bainite, lath bainite, polygonal ferrite, and M-A constituent.

ID WELDABILITY
AB The welding process has been recently introduced to join of the materials fabricated by powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) to meet the requirement for the large parts and their repair in service. However, one of the main issues is the high susceptibility to the hydrogen pores occurred during fusion welding of the PBF aluminum (Al) alloys. Autogenous laser welding of a selective laser melting (SLM) AlSi10Mg alloy was firstly carried out in comparison with the casting AlSi10Mg alloy to examine the hydrogen pore characteristics. Singlepass welding with filler powders and laser melting deposition (LMD) welding were then performed on SLM AlSi10Mg alloys to reduce the hydrogen pores. The porosity, microstructure, microhardness and tensile property of the welded joints were investigated. As a result, a high susceptibility to hydrogen pores of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys is occurred in the weld metal (WM) of the welded joint produced by autogenous laser welding and singlepass laser welding due to the high hydrogen content pre-existing in the base metal (BM). However, LMD welding has been shown to effectively reduce the pore size and the porosity generated in the WM of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys. The laser welding of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys produces lower hardness and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) than that of the BM. However, the LMD welding of SLM AlSi10Mg alloys achieves higher hardness and UTS than those of the autogenous laser welding and single-pass laser welding, which is attributed to the refined microstructures and the reduced hydrogen pores in the WM.

AB Carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP)/aluminum hybrid joints are promising for lightweight aircraft design. Welding methods such as friction spot joining (FSpJ) minimize damage to CFRTP fiber structures, making them ideal for hybrid joint fabrication. However, the inherent chemical and physical incompatibility between CFRTP and aluminum hinder strong bonding. To address this, we propose a multiscale interfacial engineering strategy combining mechanical interlocking, covalent/hydrogen bonding, and process optimization. Biomimetic papilla was textured on A6061-T6 aluminum (6061) by femtosecond laser to realize the mechanical interlock with micro and nano scales. Hydroxy group was grafted onto CFRTP to induce the formation of Al-O covalencies and hydrogen bonds, reconstructing the interfacial bonding behavior. The surficial modifications of 6061 and CFRTP worked together to improve the compatibility of the two dissimilar materials. An orthogonal experiment was carried out to optimize the process parameters of friction spot joining (FSpJ), which restrained the formation of the welding defects and increased the density of the interfacial covalent bonds of the hybrid joints. An orthogonal experiment optimized FSpJ parameters, reducing defects and increasing bond density. Meta-learning validated strength prediction with minimal data, supporting parameter selection. The resulting joints achieved highest joining strength of 44.82 MPa and efficiency of 84.57 %. Current work offers a scalable approach for high-reliability CFRTP/metal joints in aerospace and automotive applications.

AB In this work, the hydrogen embrittlement of super duplex stainless steel tubes UNS S32750 under different hydrogen charging conditions was investigated. Hydrogen charging was performed both in unloaded and in elastically stressed specimens. The tubes were charged and tested under two conditions: as-received and welded. The samples were submitted to tensile tests in order to evaluate how the mechanical properties are affected by the hydrogen inserted into the microstructure. The fracture surfaces were analyzed in order to identify the failure active micro mechanisms. Combined tensile test results and microstructural investigations indicated that elastic stress applied to samples during hydrogen charging enhanced hydrogen solubility and permeability, resulting in greater loss of ductility. As pointed by fractographies of welded H-charged tubes, the microstructural changes induced by welding increased hydrogen diffusivity. The fracture surface of the hydrogen charged as-received tubes exhibited a quasi-cleavage aspect, indicating a mixed failure mechanism composed by plastic strain in austenite and cleavage on ferrite. Otherwise, the main mechanism of failure on welded tubes was cleavage. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Joining titanium alloy with carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) is one of the hot subjects in the automotive and aerospace industries. To improve the joint strength of TC4/CFRTP PA6, this study combined the surface treatment of TC4 alloy, including laser ablation, Silane Coupling Agent (SCA) treatment, and interfacial PA6 adhesive. The results showed that the pretreatment and the laser texturing induced the micro-scale porous and macro-scale groove grid structure, respectively. The superhydrophilicity of the laser texturing as well as amino polar groups induced by SCA treatment promoted the adhesion of the thermoplastic PA6 melt into the microstructure of the TC4 alloy surface. The mechanical interlocking and hydrogen bonding between TC4 alloy and CFRTP PA6 significantly improved the shear strength of the TC4/CFRTP PA6 joint (17.5 MPa). Furthermore, with the incorporation of interfacial PA6 adhesive, the joint strength was further enhanced, and the damage of the TC4/CFRTP PA6 joint was transformed from interfacial to interlaminar CFRTP PA6.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint. Design/methodology/approach Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) were adopted to characterize the microstructure of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint. Through potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and corrosion fatigue experiments, the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy base metal and welded joint were studied. Findings The results show that the corrosion fatigue crack initiation of 6005A aluminum alloy base metal and welded joint is mainly caused by the preferential anodic dissolution and hydrogen concentration in the areas with inclusions and welding defects. Originality/value The research is an originality study on the corrosion fatigue behavior and mechanism of 6005A aluminum alloy and welded joint.

AB To investigate the mutual effect of hydrogen, microstructures and stress concentration on the fatigue failure, fatigue behaviors of X65 steel welded joints in both air and saturated H2S solution were investigated at high cycle regime. The experimental result demonstrates that due to lower dislocation density observed by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), the fine grain heat affected zone (FGHAZ) is prone to induce cyclic strain localization and further lead to fatigue crack propagating along the FGHAZ in air. Furthermore, the quasi-cleavage with brittle-like fatigue striations and secondary crack on the fracture surface in saturated H2S solution is attributed to hydrogen embrittlement. Moreover, compared with base metal (BM) and FGHAZ, the weld metal (WM) and coarse grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ) are composed of bainite and martensite/austenite (M/A) phase, and more sensitive to hydrogen. Therefore, the fatigue crack is prone to grow along the interface between WM and CGHAZ under the normal applied stress. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a joint investigation principle using experimental and theoretical approaches, we report that the anisotropic growth of Pt on Pd nanocubes significantly promotes the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2). The superior H2O2 productivity of the anisotropic Pd@Pt core@shell nanocrystals results from the enhanced H-2 conversion and the H2O2 selectivity compared to Pd and Pt. From the joint investigation, during the anisotropic growth of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, high-index facets such as (210) are generated, and they provide numerous active sites for hydrogen dissociation. Notably, even the nano-catalyst is enclosed by Pt shell, the high-index facets are favorable for opening a new route for hydrogen dissolution into the Pd bulk lattices of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, in which the dissolved hydrogen can react with chemisorbed O-2 over the nanocrystals to form H2O2. This mechanism is suggested by a hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) analysis, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study provides another option to improve the catalytic performance of core@shell nanocrystals via the generation of high-index facets through anisotropic growth of nanocrystals, in addition to the well-known strain and charge transfer effects. We expect that the anisotropic growth approach could be extended to other catalytic reactions.

AB We revealed the effects of hydrogen on the microstructural evolution and passive film properties of a 2205 duplex stainless steel by the joint use of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements. The microstructural analysis results show that effects of hydrogen on the two phases are different: (i) in austenite, stacking faults are induced by hydrogen, and (ii) in ferrite, hydrogen causes an increase of the dislocation density. The XPS analysis revealed that hydrogen reduced the occurrence of Cr2O3 and nitrogen in the passive film, leading to the reduction of their overall thickness. Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrated that the hydrogen release time plays an important role in the electrochemical behavior of the hydrogen charged steel.

AB Controlling the mutual structure between different materials in the heterostructured composites is of key importance in determining their properties and further applications. In this work, joint molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets supported by vertically standing graphene (VSG) were fabricated by full chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, thus leading to precisely tailoring the support-joint coupling structures between VSG support and joint MoS2 nanosheets in the as-fabricated MoS2/VSG or (MoS2-MoO3_x)/VSG hybrid architectures. Which were then directly used as effective, stable and binder-free electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and revealing that the CVD loading mode of MoS2 (or MoS2-MoO3_x) on VSG support in a vertically or obliquely inserted three-dimensional (3D) architecture has a key influence on improving their HER activities. These results shed light on structural design of multicomponent heterostructures by coupling engineering for various applications.

AB In this study, the susceptibility of API X70 weld joints to hydrogen gas was investigated using slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests. The microstructure of the subregion of the actual heat-affected zone (HAZ) weld joint was reproduced by weld thermal-cycle simulation techniques. The SSRT results showed that the weld and cross-weld specimens had the highest hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility, followed by the subregions of the fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) specimens and the base metal. The HE index ranking of the samples was as follows (in increasing sequence): weld, cross-weld, simulated FGHAZ, simulated CGHAZ, and base metal specimens. The rupture location of the cross-weld specimen in ambient air is different to that tested in 10 MPa H-2. The higher susceptibility of the weld and cross-weld specimens was primarily attributed to synergic effects between the microstructural characteristics, stress localization, and microhardness distribution - particularly, microhardness plays an important role in the nucleation of microcracks and the hydrogen diffusion rate induced by stress/strain localization.

AB Armor steels are widely recognized for their exceptional mechanical and ballistic performance, particularly in the fabrication of armored vehicles. Austenitic stainless steel (ASS) wires are commonly used in their welding processes to mitigate hydrogen-induced cracking. However, joints formed using ASS often suffer from reduced ballistic performance due to the strength mismatch (undermatching) compared to the base material. This study explores the application of butt joints, integrating low hydrogen ferritic (LHF) deposits between softer ASS weld layers, which can be expressed as sandwich layer design, in gas metal arc welded (GMAW) armor steel plates. The mechanical properties were evaluated through hardness, tensile, and Charpy V-notch impact tests. Ballistics test performances were measured using depth of penetration (DoP) and width of penetration (WoP) values. The microstructural analysis utilized stereo, optical, and scanning electron microscopes. The results demonstrated that the sandwich joint configuration met the Charpy-V impact toughness requirements of the base metal, achieving 31.4 J and 65 J at-40 degrees C for the WM and HAZ regions, respectively, compared to 20 J for the base material. Moreover, this innovative joint design effectively combined the high toughness and ductility of austenitic wire, reaching a low DoP value of 7.2 mm, with the superior strength of ferritic filler metal, which contributes to a low WoP value of 12.5 mm and a joint efficiency of 48 %. By combining these properties, the joint design significantly enhances ballistic performance in welded regions, traditionally considered vulnerable to ballistic threats, without compromising overall mechanical integrity.

AB This study investigates the mechanical performance of X80 pipeline steel and its welded joints in hydrogenblended natural gas environments at 10 MPa. Slow strain rate tensile, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue crack growth, and fracture toughness tests are conducted on base metal, weld metal, and heat-affected zone. Hydrogen addition reduces ductility, increases fatigue crack growth rate by nearly one order of magnitude, and lowers fracture toughness by up to 51.9 %. The predicted fatigue life decreases by as much as 94.5 % with 30 vol% hydrogen blending. Fatigue crack growth rate and fracture toughness tests indicated that the base metal exhibited the highest hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity, followed by the weld metal and the heat-affected zone. However, all specimens maintain fatigue lives exceeding one million cycles under typical pressure fluctuations. These results suggest that hydrogen transport through existing natural gas pipelines may be feasible when considering the pipe material alone. The findings provide essential data for evaluating the hydrogen compatibility of X80 steel in realistic gas mixtures and contribute to the development of safe hydrogen blending strategies.

AB The surfaces of X80 pipeline steel welded joints were processed with a CO2 laser, and the effects of laser heat treatment (LHT) on H2S stress corrosion in the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) solution were analyzed by a slow strain rate test. The fracture morphologies and chemical components of corrosive products before and after LHT were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively, and the mechanism of LHT on stress corrosion cracking was discussed. Results showed that the fracture for welded joints was brittle in its original state, while it was transformed to a ductile fracture after LHT. The tendencies of hydrogen-induced corrosion were reduced, and the stress corrosion sensitivity index decreased from 35.2% to 25.3%, indicating that the stress corrosion resistance of X80 pipeline steel welded joints has been improved by LHT.

AB The effect of internal hydrogen in the fatigue crack growth rate of the coarse grain region of a 2.25Cr1Mo steel welded joint was analyzed in this work. The microstructure of the coarse grain region was simulated by means of a heat treatment able to provide the same microstructure with a similar prior austenite grain size and hardness to the one in a real welded joint. The fatigue crack growth rate was measured under standard laboratory conditions using compact tensile (CT) specimens that were (i) uncharged and hydrogen pre-charged in a hydrogen pressure reactor (under 19.5 MPa and 450 degrees C for 21 h). The influence of fatigue frequency was assessed using frequencies of 10 Hz, 0.1 Hz, and 0.05 Hz. Additionally, two load ratios (R = 0.1 and R = 0.5) were applied to analyze their influence in the da/dN vs. Delta K curves and therefore in the fatigue crack growth rate. The embrittlement produced by the presence of internal hydrogen was clearly noticed at the beginning of the fatigue crack growth rate test (Delta K = 30 MP root m), obtaining significant higher values than without hydrogen. This effect became more notorious as the test frequency decreased and the load ratio increased. At the same time, the failure mechanism changed from ductile (striations) to brittle (hydrogen decohesion) with intergranular fracture (IG) becoming the predominant failure mechanism under the highest loads (R = 0.5).

AB This study demonstrates effective resistance welding between 7075 aluminum (Al) alloy and carbon fiber/polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites by combining chemical etching and silanization surface treatments with a polyetherimide (PEI) thermoplastic layer. The effects of this hybrid treatment on the bonding at the 7075 Al alloy/PEI thermoplastic layer interface and the mechanical performance of the welded joints are systematically investigated. Chemical etching created a micro-nano rough surface that enhanced mechanical interlocking and increased hydroxyl group content from 12.7 mol% to 28.5 mol%. Subsequent silanization grafted amino (-NH2) groups onto the 7075 Al alloy surface, enabling hydrogen bonding with the PEI thermoplastic layer. Under the synergistic effects of mechanical interlocking and hydrogen bonding, interfacial bonding is significantly enhanced, increasing the lap shear strength (LSS) of the joint from 0.2 to 24.6 MPa. The fracture failure mode of the welded joint changes from the interfacial failure of the 7075 Al alloy and PEI thermoplastic layer to the interlaminar failure of carbon fiber tearing in the heating element.

AB High temperature in diffusion bonding (DB) process severely deteriorates the performance of zirconium (Zr) R60702 in extreme chemical environment. Therefore, it is important to reduce the DB temperature of Zr R60702. In this work, low-temperature diffusion bonding of Zr R60702 at 750 & DEG;C is realized by 0.3 wt% hydrogen addition while 900 & DEG;C is required in DB process for unhydrogenated Zr R60702. The shear strength of the hydrogenated joint bonded at 750 & DEG;C reaches 388 MPa, which is 117.98% higher than that of the unhydrogenated joint bonded at 750 & DEG;C and equal to that of the unhydrogenated joint bonded at 900 & DEG;C. The effects of hydrogen addition in Zr R60702 on the microstructure evolution, phase transformation temperature, interatomic bonding and self-diffusion coefficient of Zr atoms are investigated in detail. The results show that the optimized DB properties can be attributed to the improvements of its grain boundary diffusion, plasticity and self-diffusion coefficient of Zr atoms.

AB Pipeline welding is an integral part of oil and gas exploration industries. Often the weld failures are observed due to lack of weld quality, improper heat treatment and poor workmanship. Further, the use of new materials in pipeline industry puts focus on a better understanding of requirements for welding and reducing the failures in future. This necessitates the need for development and design of suitable welding fluxes for joining of these materials. In this paper an attempt is made to analyse the effect of commercial submerged arc welding flux and laboratory prepared agglomerated submerged arc welding fluxes (of basic, rutile basic and rutile acidic type) on the weldability, microstructural evolution as well as the structural integrity issues in API X70 line pipe steel welds. The mechanical and microstructural behaviour of weld joints was observed for submerged arc welding fluxes. The maximum tensile strength of 613 N/mm(2) was observed for weld joint prepared using commercial flux (C.F). While in case of agglomerated fluxes the maximum value of tensile strength observed was 561 N/mm(2) for F15B basic flux. Impact toughness for all the weld joints was evaluated both at room temperature and at -65 degrees C. For the weld as well as the heat-affected zone, the maximum impact toughness (160 J and 436 J) was observed for basic flux F5B at room temperature while at - 65 degrees C (16 J and 30 J) impact toughness was obtained which was similar to that obtained with commercial flux. Microhardness of commercial weld joint (232 HV) is maximum as compared to the other weld joints. Maximum microhardness of 222 HV was observed for weld joint fabricated with flux F15B. Flux F15B shows a maximum value of microhardness (218 HV) for the heat-affected zone. Weld joints fabricated by using F3RA and F19RA fluxes exhibit high susceptibility to hydrogen induced cracking as compared to the remaining weld joints. The crack sensitivity ratio (CSR %) is high for weld specimen F3RA (54.64%) and F19RA (50.26%) while weld specimen fabricated using (F5B and C.F) fluxes show minimum crack sensitivity ratio (27.54% & 30.97%) respectively. The high susceptibility towards hydrogen induced cracking may be attributed to the very low value of carbon equivalent as compared to the remaining weld joints.

AB Superwood is a densified wood product that shows promise as a lightweight and renewable alternative for metallic materials. In order for this high-performance new material to be used in multi-material products, it must be able to be joined with other major materials. For example, joining superwood to aluminum would provide a key enabling technology for its use in automotive components since aluminum is presently a major lightweight material for such applications. In this paper, a methacrylate-based adhesive has been identified to provide high lap shear strength (7.5 MPa) for aluminum-to-superwood joints. The aluminum-to-superwood samples were prepared with different amounts of pre-polishing to create openings to the pores in the superwood so adhesive could penetrate into them and create a mechanical interlock, in addition to the hydrogen/chemical bonding at the surface between the methyl methacrylate (MMA) in methacrylate-based adhesive and the cellulose in superwood. For aluminum samples, a thin layer (typically a few nanometers) of oxide film on the surfaces provides hydrogen/chemical bond to MMA structure in the adhesive layer. The failure strength of the superwood-to-aluminum joint sample is about 50% higher than that of natural wood to natural wood joint sample and comparable to that of aluminum-to-aluminum joint sample.

TI Waiting time before NDT of welded offshore steel grades under
   consideration of delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD
LA English
DT Article
DE Welding (GMA); Offshore steels; Non-destructive testing (NDT);
   Diffusible hydrogen Tekken test
AB Offshore wind turbines (OWT) are a major goal of the energy strategy of Germany encompassing the increase of the installed wind power. OWT components are manufactured from welded steel plates with thicknesses up to 200 mm. The underlying standards and technical recommendations for construction of OWTs encompass specifications of so-called minimum waiting time (MWT) before non-destructive testing of the weld joints is allowed. Reason is the increased risk of time-delayed hydrogen-assisted cold cracking as hydrogen diffusion is very slow due to the very thick plates. The strict consideration of those long MWT up to 48 h during the construction of OWTs leads to significant financial burden (like disproportionately high costs for installer ships as well as storage problems (onshore)). In this study, weld joints made of S355 ML were examined in comparison with the offshore steel grade S460 G2+M. The aim was to optimize, i.e., reduce, the MWT before NDT considering varied heat input, hydrogen concentration and using self-restraint weld tests. This would significantly reduce the manufacturing time and costs of OWT construction. To quantify the necessary delay time until hydrogen-assisted cold cracks appear, acoustic emission analysis was applied directly after welding for at least 48 h.

AB The surfaces of welded joints on Grade X80 pipeline steel were processed with a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, and the effects of this laser heat treatment (LHT) on electrochemical corrosion in a solution saturated with hydrogen sulfde (H2S) were analyzed with electrochemical corrosion tests. The microstructures and residual stresses of the joints were analyzed before and after LHT. The surface corrosion morphologies and chemical components of corrosion products before and after LHT were observed. The results show that the self-corrosion potentials of the welded joints increased from -670 to -600 mV; and the corrosion morphologies changed from total corrosion to local corrosion, with improved corrosion resistance.

AB The replacement of hydrogen with conventional fossil fuel has been viewed as a feasible route to the ZERO emission transportation. Nowadays, the water electrolysis method has become mature and efficient enough to produce large scale of hydrogen, and the condensation and reliquefaction technologies also greatly reduce the hydrogen loss via pipeline transmission, which both motivate the applications of hydrogen as a fuel. In this study, a combined power-hydrogen network is planned to supply the power demand of residential blocks and the charging/fueling demand for electrical vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, respectively. However, the joint scheduling of power-hydrogen network is challenging due to the nonlinearity and nonconvexity inherited from the hydraulic dynamics of hydrogen transmission. To resolve this problem, a convex-concave-based sequential convex approximation method is proposed. A revised 37-bus system is used to demonstrate the validity of proposed method.

AB This work focuses on the corrosion behavior of the friction stir welded joint of aluminum alloy 3003. In order to quantify the quality of FSW joints, the corrosion in the welded joint and the base metal was compared. A gravimetric and thermodynamic study was carried out to determine corrosion resistance. Three aggressive media based on three solutions (sodium chloride, hydrogen chloride, and ethylene glycol) at four temperatures (25 degrees, 45 degrees, 65 degrees, and 85 degrees C) were tested. The results showed that temperature has a strong influence on corrosion rates, which are higher in the metal than in the FSW joint. The presence of ethylene glycol considerably reduces the rate of corrosion, its effect is more marked on the FSW joint. The adsorption of ethylene glycol on the surface of the base metal and that of the FSW joint follows the Langmuir isotherm to form a monolayer on the surface of both samples.

AB Effect of pulsed laser welding parameters (pulse energy and duration, frequency, welding speed and, as a result, overlapping factor) on properties of E110 (Zr-1%Nb) alloy welds is presented. Butt welded joints of two identical plates with a thickness of 0.5 mm were investigated. EDS analysis of a surface layer of the welds was done, initial hydrogen concentration in the weld metal was measured and influence of absorbed gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen) on tensile strength, microhardness, hydrogen absorption rate and corrosion resistance of the welds was evaluated. The weld metal contained initial hydrogen concentration within the limits set by standards. However, mixing argon flows with atmospheric gases caused the weld metal contamination with oxygen, nitrogen and carbon. As a result, inclusions of complex chemical composition and surface branching microcracks were formed. They were stress raisers where weld failures occurred. Furthermore, it was the reason of increased hydrogen absorption rate and decreased corrosion resistance of the weld metal. The obtained results showed that absence of discoloration on surfaces of the welded joints did not guarantee metal purity and, as a consequence, required performance properties. Future research is required to determine the optimal overlapping factor; shielding gas compositions (Ar, He or their mixture) and flow rates; configuration and inclination angle of nozzles as well as distance from the nozzles to the weld zone.

AB Historically, few studies have examined sealing failure in twin ferrule pipeline fittings under extreme temperatures. This research investigates their sealing performance in onboard hydrogen systems under such conditions. Experimental results revealed divergent low-temperature sealing behavior: one fitting showed no leakage, while the other leaked 100-200 ppm. Material analyses indicated that surface processing quality influences sealing but is not the decisive factor. Instead, the material mismatch between the front ferrule and the joint body was identified as the primary cause of sealing failure from room temperature to low temperature. Finite element method (FEM) simulations at 19.85 degrees C and -40 degrees C confirmed experimental findings. To reduce hydrogen leakage in fuel cell vehicles at low temperatures, the study recommends using consistent materials for the front ferrule and joint body.

AB The microstructures of high strength bainitic steel weldments were characterized, and their hydrogen permeability was investigated by the electrochemical permeation technique. The effective diffusion coefficient in the welded joint increases with heat input, while the hydrogen concentration at the sub-surface decreases with increasing heat input, mainly due to coarsening grain and inclusion sizes. Compared with as-welded specimens, the tempered membranes have lower effective diffusion coefficient and higher density of hydrogen traps due to newly formed carbides acting as hydrogen trapping sites that are derived from the decomposition of martensite-austenite constituents. These were further confirmed by the partial permeation technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to make full use of renewable energy and improve the utilization of wind power, a new joint optimization scheme of the wind-hydrogen system coupled with transmission project is proposed in this paper, in which wind power is reasonably allocated for grid integration and for hydrogen production. Aiming at maximize the annul wind-hydrogen system benefit, the optimal sizes of wind power transmission project and hydrogen system are obtained under different hydrogen production modes, hydrogen trading modes and hydrogen demand levels. In addition, the penalty cost of wind curtailment and hydrogen supply shortage and the system environmental benefits are taken into account. Results show: during the long-term of insufficient of wind power, it is better to produce hydrogen using wind power and grid-assisted power to avoid hydrogen supply shortage; considering the future increase of hydrogen demand, the optimal supply number of hydrogen refueling stations in the wind-hydrogen system is two. Also, the low utilization of fuel cells means that the benefit from regeneration cannot offset the high cost, which leads to the abnegation of fuel cells in the wind-hydrogen system.

Hydrogen desorption and hydrogen sorption from gaseous mixtures were analysed. The calculated results are compared with experimental data obtained in the Joint Institute of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Science. The agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data is demonstrated to be satisfactory. It is indicated that to increase the efficiency of hydrogen purification in a metal-hydride reactor, the thickness of the porous bed cooled by external water must be no more than 6-8 mm.

AB Hydrogen-induced cracking behavior in high-strength steel mainly composed of martensite was analyzed by acoustic emission (AE) technique and finite element method (FEM) in slow strain-rate tensile (SSRT) tests and welding tests. The crack initiation was detected by the AE signals, and the time evolution of stress concentration and hydrogen diffusion were calculated by FEM. The effect of hardness and plastic strain on the hydrogen diffusion coefficient was explicitly introduced into the governing equation in FEM. The criterion and indicator parameter for the crack initiation were derived as a function of maximum principal stress and locally accumulated hydrogen concentration. The results showed that the cracking criterion derived by AE and FEM is useful for predicting the cold cracking behavior and determining the critical preheat temperature to prevent hydrogen-induced cracking.

AB The 316LN Stainless Steel (SS) weld joints were fabricated using Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding and Activated Flux Tungsten Inert Gas (A-TIG) Welding techniques with suitable process parameters. Initially, basic mechanical properties were evaluated across weld joints. Further microstructural study of the base metal, TIG, and A-TIG joints were accomplished using Optical Microscopy (OM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The microstructural characterization revealed higher grain size variations at the fusion zone of the A-TIG joint due to the slow cooling rate and reversed Marangoni convection effect. The Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) susceptibility of the TIG and A-TIG welded joints was assessed using five different loading/Stress conditions. The constant load boiling 45 wt% Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (MgCl(2 center dot)6H(2)O) solution as per ASTM G36-94 standard was used to evaluate the SCC susceptibility of the welded joints. The SCC (crack initiation and propagation) of the base metal and welded joints occurred by the anodic dissolution and Hydrogen Induced Cracking mechanisms. For the welded joints additionally, the dissolution of the delta-ferrite increased the crack growth rate. The A-TIG joint exhibited lesser SCC resistance than the TIG joint for the following major reasons: (i) Formation of the large dendrites (ii) Presence of the higher grain size variations at the fusion zone. Moreover, both welded joints showed lesser SCC resistance than the base metal due to the dissolution of the delta-ferrite and the residual stress formation. The fractographic studies for the base metal, TIG, and A-TIG joints revealed the brittle nature of transgranular SCC failure.

AB The carbide characteristics of 2.25Cr1Mo0.25V steel have an extremely important influence on the mechanical properties of welding joints. In addition, hydrogen resistance behavior is crucial for steel applied in hydrogenation reactors. The carbide morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the carbide microstructure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tensile and impact tests were carried out and the influence of carbides on properties was studied. A hydrogen diffusion test was carried out, and the hydrogen brittleness resistance of welding metal and base metal was studied by tensile testing of hydrogenated samples to evaluate the influence of hydrogen on the mechanical properties. The research results show that the strength of the welding metal was slightly higher and the Charpy impact value was significantly lower compared to the base metal. The hydrogen embrittlement resistance of the welding metal was stronger than that of the base metal. The presence of more carbides and inclusions was the main cause of the decreased impact property and hydrogen brittleness resistance of the welding metal. These conclusions have certain reference value for designing and manufacturing hydrogenation reactors.

AB An initial thermal power dispatch (TPD) concept of operations was evaluated that couples a nuclear power plant to a nearby hydrogen production plant. GSE Systems' generic pressurized water reactor full-scope simulator was modified with a TPD model comprised of a thermal power extraction and delivery system. A prototype human-system interface (HSI) was developed to interact with the TPD model and allow participants to execute the basic operating scenarios for normal operations. Four retired operators performed the evaluation, and due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the original in-person experimental design was restructured to support a remote participator evaluation using a web meeting platform. Data from operator feedback, observations from the research team, and quantitative survey responses revealed that the initial TPD concept of operations is feasible. The operators were comfortable with the engineered system and HSI and could manage it without adverse impacts to reactor power, plant safety, or equipment. Findings are discussed in terms of both the TPD system design and HSI performance.

AB The recent literature has demonstrated that overbuilding & proactive curtailment of renewables is a necessary puzzle piece in achieving the lowest-cost firm power, which is the kind of power from renewables that can satisfy load demand with 100% certainty-firming up renewables, which can be gauged via firm kWh premium, is synonymous with turning the business-as-usual variable renewables into effectively dispatchable ones and implies curtailed power. Although some studies have examined the benefits of utilizing curtailed electricity for hydrogen production, there is currently a lack of in-depth exploration on how to economically configure a fully renewables-dominated firm generation system and a hydrogen production system while ensuring 100% load fulfillment. Besides, various firm power enablers, which refer to technologies that help achieve firm generation, such as wind-solar blending or the aforementioned overbuilding, are often limited to quantitative analyses. Thus, this work evaluates the feasibility of utilizing nearly zero-cost curtailed power for hydrogen production in the context of firm power generation. Two highlights of this work that differentiate it from previous studies are that: (1) a theoretical paradigm for the coordinated deployment of a firm wind-photovoltaic-battery system under a firm-power condition and a hydrogen system has been established from the perspectives of joint optimization and separate optimization; and (2) the deep coupling relationships among various enablers are investigated, and a qualitative analysis is conducted on the impacts of battery storage sharing and wind-solar blending in reducing the system premium in the domain of firm power delivery. The case study demonstrates the economic viability of including hydrogen production in a firm renewable system. The firm kWh premium of the joint strategy reaches a value of 1.82, whereas the separate strategy sees an increase to 2.23. Compared to the absence of battery storage sharing, utilizing shared storage reduces the system premium by 44.85%. Besides, the premium increases by 27.47% when the wind farm is not installed. These results reveal that joint optimization, battery storage sharing, and wind-solar blending can all contribute beneficially towards a firm-power setup.

ID MECHANISM; BEHAVIOR
AB The use of Mg alloys for vehicle weight reduction has been increasing rapidly worldwide. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) has the potential for mass-production welding of Mg alloys. Recently, the University of Wisconsin demonstrated in bead-on-plate GMAW of Mg alloys that: 1) the issue of severe spatter, which has long delayed the use of GMAW for Mg alloys, can be eliminated by using controlled short circuiting (CSC), and 2) the issue of severe hydrogen porosity can be eliminated by removing Mg(OH)(2), which forms on the welding wire surface over time. The present study aimed at actual butt and lap joint welding of Mg alloys by CSC-GMAW. The most widely used wrought Mg alloy AZ31 Mg (Mg-similar to-3Al-1Zn-0.2Mn) was welded by CSC-GMAW. Sound welds were made without spatter and hydrogen porosity, with butt joint welds approaching 100% of the base-metal strength. However, three new significant issues were found to occur easily and degrade the weld quality significantly: 1) formation of oxide films inside butt joint welds, 2) formation of high crowns on butt joint welds, and 3) formation of fingers from lap joint welds. These three new issues, like the issues of spatter and porosity investigated previously, were caused mainly by the unusual physical and chemical properties of Mg, rather than the welding process itself. These properties include the low liquid density, low solid deformability, low liquid fluidity, and high oxygen affinity of Mg. The mechanisms of their formation were established, and the methods for their elimination or reduction were demonstrated.

DE Liquefied hydrogen; HAZID; Risk assessment; Incidents
AB The objectives of the IDEALHY project, which receives funding from the European Union's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) for the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative under grant agreement No. 278177, are to design a novel process that will significantly increase the efficiency of hydrogen liquefaction and be capable of delivering liquid hydrogen at a rate that is an order of magnitude greater than current plants. The liquid hydrogen could then be delivered to refueling stations in road tankers. This paper describes the scope of the safety work within IDEALHY, focussing in particular on two HAZID exercises and a review of incidents. In particular, an analysis of the causes and consequences of accident scenarios is presented. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Protein neutron crystallography is a powerful technique to determine the positions of H atoms, providing crucial biochemical information such as the protonation states of catalytic groups and the geometry of hydrogen bonds. Recently, the crystal structure of a bacterial copper amine oxidase was determined by joint refinement using X-ray and neutron diffraction data sets at resolutions of 1.14 and 1.72 angstrom, respectively [Murakawa et al. (2020). Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 117, 10818-10824]. While joint refinement is effective for the determination of the accurate positions of heavy atoms on the basis of the electron density, the structural information on light atoms (hydrogen and deuterium) derived from the neutron diffraction data might be affected by the X-ray data. To unravel the information included in the neutron diffraction data, the structure determination was conducted again using only the neutron diffraction data at 1.72 angstrom resolution and the results were compared with those obtained in the previous study. Most H and D atoms were identified at essentially the same positions in both the neutron-only and the X-ray/neutron joint refinements. Nevertheless, neutron-only refinement was found to be less effective than joint refinement in providing very accurate heavy-atom coordinates that lead to significant improvement of the neutron scattering length density map, especially for the active-site cofactor. Consequently, it was confirmed that X-ray/neutron joint refinement is crucial for determination of the real chemical structure of the catalytic site of the enzyme.

AB This work analyses the trading of strategic merchant hydrogen technologies in energy and ancillary services markets. The hydrogen firms trade in two markets: (1) a joint hydrogen and energy/reserves day -ahead market and (2) the balancing settlements market. We contrast the co -optimised markets with trading in an energy -only market. Trading both energy and ancillary services leads hydrogen firms to produce and use more hydrogen, leading to less reliance on fossil fuels and an increase in the revenue streams of the electrolysis -based firms. The problem is formulated as a stochastic multi -leader -multi -follower model. Each leader firm solves a bi-level Stackelberg problem. The upper -level is the Nash game among strategic firms. The lower -level is an instance of a Generalised Nash Equilibrium of the followers.

AB This work evaluates the effect of hydrogen on the mechanical integrity of a weld in a martensitic base metal. Different regions in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) are reproduced to investigate the interaction of the local microstructure with hydrogen. The hardness strongly depends on the distance from the welding joint due to the different phases present. The HAZ contains zones of acicular ferrite, coarse martensite and tempered martensite. Additionally, the entire weld is subjected to a constant load while being simultaneously electrochemically charged with hydrogen. During this test, a crack initiates in the filler, showing the highest hydrogen solubility as demonstrated by thermal desorption spectroscopy, while propagation occurs along the microstructure of the HAZ with the highest hardness level.

ID OPTIMAL OPERATION
AB The integration of green energy sources such as hydrogen and natural gas plays a vital role in advancing lowcarbon energy goals. Conventional integrated energy systems (IES) employing hydrogen-compressed natural gas (HCNG) typically operate with fixed mixing ratio, limiting flexibility and overlooking positive market feedback effects. This study proposes an optimal scheduling strategy for an IES with a dynamic hydrogen blending ratio within a joint carbon-green certificate trading framework. This model considers wind power penetration impacts on electrolysis efficiency using a dynamic electrolyzer efficiency model and incorporates operation and maintenance costs of HCNG pipelines. A trading strategy based on equivalence between green certificates and carbon quotas is developed to improve economic performance and emissions reduction. The influence of hydrogen production levels on carbon trading and market revenues is examined. A case study demonstrates that this method achieves a 25.16 % cost reduction, 17.21 % decrease in emissions, and 98.8 %a wind energy utilization.

AB The effect of ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) on the corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behavior of low carbon steel (ASTM A139) welded joint in the simulated district heating water (internal heating water) were investigated. After UNSM treatment, the microstructures of welded joint were transformed from the grain boundary ferrite and wid-manstatten ferrite to polygonal ferrite accompanied by grain refinement. In electrochemical tests, the corrosion resistance of the welded joint was increased after UNSM treatment as a result of the grain refinement and improved stability of the oxide film. The stress corrosion cracking behavior was measured by slow strain rate tests with accelerated anodic and cathodic reactions. The results indicated that the UNSM treatment had a significant effect on the corrosion condition, whereas UNSM had no effect on hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Oxy-fuel combustion technology offers a promising solution for achieving nearly zero carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired units, presenting a viable path toward low-carbon dispatch. This study establishes a simulation model for the low-carbon operation of power systems, focusing on the integrated operation of an oxy-fuel combustion plant and electric hydrogen production. By incorporating oxygen generated from electric hydrogen production into the oxy-fuel combustion plant, the primary objective is to minimize system operation costs. Through simulation analysis and verification, a comparative scenario is constructed to evaluate performance. The simulation results indicate that the joint operation approach yields significant benefits. In comparison to separate operation, the joint operation strategy leads to a reduction of approximately 7.38% in total system costs, 18.79% in operating costs, and 23.56% in carbon emissions. This integrated approach not only achieves lower carbon emissions but also results in reduced overall system costs.

HSC behaviours were compared for base metal (BM) and transverse-weld joints (WJs) using in-situ slow strain rate testing (SSRT) with hydrogen charging. The HSC resistivity of transverse WJs was inferior to that of BM. The transverse WJs were fractured in the BM during SSRT in hydrogen-free condition. The in-situ SSRT changed the fracture location to the inter-critical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) for transverse WJs and granular bainite in ICHAZ acted as the initiation site of HSC in transverse welds.

AB The proton/hydrogen redox couple underpins the electrochemical sciences; however, the nonunity stoichiometry of the reaction leads to distinct voltammetric complications. This Article provides a joint analytical, numerical, and experimental investigation into the reversible hydrogen evolution reaction at a platinum microelectrode. Literature obscurities and nuances are highlighted and corrected, allowing the presentation of an holistic overview of the electrochemical reaction at the reversible limit. Under such conditions, it is demonstrated, first, how the reaction may be misinterpreted as being irreversible and, second, that the transfer coefficient for the reversible (Nernstian) hydrogen evolution reaction is equal to 2. Importantly, the use of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference potential in voltammetric experiments is critically evaluated.

AB The permeation of hydrogen in the X80 steel was studied in this paper through thermal desorption spectroscopy, stepwise hydrogen permeation experiments and finite element modelling. Firstly, one kind of shallow trap and deep traps in X80 steel were identified through thermal desorption spectroscopy and the corresponding binding energies were obtained. According to the experiment and simulation, the deep hydrogen traps can significantly retard the first hydrogen permeation process but have almost no effect during the following charging. The X80 steel used in hydrogen compressed natural gas pipelines is exposed to hydrogen for long periods and deep traps are filled, its hydrogen permeation process is more in line with the stepwise hydrogen charging. Therefore, the stepwise hydrogen charging experiments were performed and the apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) and the hydrogen trap density involved in the hydrogen permeation transient (N1) were obtained using three different thickness samples. Then, a quantitative relationship in X80 steel was fitted between the N1 and the variation of hydrogen concentration. Based on the quantitative relationship and the hydrogen trap binding energies, a hydrogen perme-ation model in X80 steel was established. By comparing the hydrogen permeation curves obtained by our model under different boundary conditions with experiment curves, it is found that the constant concentration boundary condition model can better describe the hydrogen permeation kinetic in X80 steel under electrochemical hydrogen charging. As a result, this model can be used to predict the distribution of hydrogen in X80 steel, laying the foundation for predicting the occurrence of hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB HyResponder is a European Hydrogen Train the Trainer programme for responders. This paper describes the key outputs of the project and the steps taken to develop and implement a long-term sustainable train the trainer programme in hydrogen safety for responders across Europe and beyond. This FCH2 JU (now Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking) funded project has built on the successful outcomes of the previous HyResponse project. HyResponder has developed further and updated educational, operational, and virtual reality training for trainers of responders to reflect the state-of-the-art in hydrogen safety, including liquid hydrogen, and expand the programme across Europe and specifically within the 10 countries represented directly within the project consortium: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. For the first time, four levels of educational materials from fire fighter through to specialist have been developed. The digital training resources are available on the e-Platform (https://hyresponder.eu/eplatform/). The revised European Emergency Response Guide is now available to all stakeholders. The resources are intended to be used to support national training programs. They are available in 8 languages: Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian and Spanish. Through the HyResponder activities, trainers from across Europe have undertaken joint actions which are in turn being used to inform the delivery of regional and national training both within and beyond the project. The established pan-European network of trainers is shaping the future in the important for inherently safer deployment of hydrogen systems and infrastructure across Europe and enhancing the reach and impact of the programme.

AB Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene was incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) via in-situ template method, forming MXene/PVA hydrogel (MPH) through hydrogen bonding between PVA chains and MXene surface groups. After 3-5 freeze-thaw cycles, the composite achieved free-standing capability, with SEM and FT-IR confirming molecular-level interactions. The 3 wt% MXene-doped MPH strain sensor exhibited exceptional sensitivity: 29.9 at >200 % elongation, and 3.43 (0-100 %) and 6.96 (100-200 %) within lower strain ranges, satisfying both wide detection range and high sensitivity requirements. When applied to joint motion monitoring, the sensor effectively distinguished signals from different joints and varying bending angles of the same joint, demonstrating promising potential for wearable healthcare applications.

AB The first wall (FW) of a water cooled ceramic breeder (WCCB) blanket uses ferritic/martensitic steel (FMS) as structural material and tungsten (W) as armor material. The FW is exposed to fusion reaction fuels: deuterium (D) or tritium (T) plasma; and HT, T-2, or HTO produced in breeding reactions. Titanium (Ti) is required as an interlayer in a W/FMS welding joint formed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP). However, Ti is sensitive to hydrogen (H) embrittlement which can result from the concentration and diffusion of H isotopes at welding interfaces. Qualitative analysis of the effect of D concentration on the W/Ti/FMS bonding quality was performed. The experiments demonstrated that D can affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the W/Ti/FMS joints at lower D concentrations. Excessive TiD2 will turn the Ti interlayer into powder, and finally lead to joint failure at higher D concentrations. The H isotope concentration in the joints shall be strictly controlled to ensure steady operation of the fusion reactor.

AB Welding porosity defects significantly reduce the mechanical properties of welded joints. In this paper, the hydrogen porosity evolution coupled with dendrite growth during solidification in the molten pool of Al-4.0 wt pct Cu alloy was modeled and simulated. Three phases, including a liquid phase, a solid phase, and a gas phase, were considered in this model. The growth of dendrites and hydrogen gas pores was reproduced using a cellular automaton (CA) approach. The diffusion of solute and hydrogen was calculated using the finite difference method (FDM). Columnar and equiaxed dendrite growth with porosity evolution were simulated. Competitive growth between different dendrites and porosities was observed. Dendrite morphology was influenced by porosity formation near dendrites. After solidification, when the porosities were surrounded by dendrites, they could not escape from the liquid, and they made pores that existed in the welded joints. With the increase in the cooling rate, the average diameter of porosities decreased, and the average number of porosities increased. The average diameter of porosities and the number of porosities in the simulation results had the same trend as the experimental results.

AB Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloy exhibits high susceptibility to hydrogen porosity during fusion welding, and the mechanical properties of the welded joint are significantly reduced compared to the base metal (BM). In this study, LPBF AlSi10Mg alloy was welded using laser metal deposition (LMD) process, followed by direct aging (DA) heat treatment at 160 degrees C for 6 h. The porosity characteristics, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the welded joints were investigated, along with an in-depth analysis of the pore formation mechanism and the strengthening mechanism induced by DA heat treatment. The results show that the increase in the number of weld passes can significantly reduce both the hydrogen pore diameter and porosity in the weld metal (WM). The porosity concentration is notably higher at the inter-pass region. After DA heat treatment, the proportion of spherical and short rod-like Si phases in the WM increased, and the connectivity of eutectic Si networks also improved. Additionally, DA heat treatment reduces kernel average misorientation and geometric necessary dislocations, decreases low-angle grain boundaries proportion, and slightly increases grain size. Schmid factor analysis confirms reduced slip system activation, improving crack resistance via strengthening from nano-Si precipitates. DA heat treatment enhanced the average hardness of the welded joints, with the maximum average hardness reaching 111.04 HV. The tensile strength of the joint reached 293.6 MPa, with an elongation of 1.7%. The enhancement of mechanical properties is attributed to the precipitation strengthening of silicon elements following DA heat treatment.

AB Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) clean systems have been increasingly adopted for Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to drive system decarbonization. However, current models for the joint operation of VPP and P2H often disregard the full impact on grid operation or hydrogen supply to multiple consumers. This paper contributes with a VPP operating model considering a full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) while integrating different paths for the use of green hydrogen, such as supplying hydrogen to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP), industry and local hydrogen consumers. The proposed framework is tested using a 37-bus distribution grid and the results illustrate the benefits that a P2H plant can bring to the VPP in economic, grid operation and environmental terms. An important conclusion is that depending on the prices of the different hydrogen services, the P2H plant can increase the levels of self-sufficiency and security of supply of the VPP, decrease the operating costs, and integrate more renewables.

AB In this work, heat treatments were performed on autogenously laser welding of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloys to improve mechanical properties of welded joints. After welding, the welded joint was heat treated by direct aging (DA) and solution heat treatment and artificial aging (T6) treatment. The porosity, microstructure and mechanical performance of the welded joints after DA and T6 treatments were investigated and compared with the as-welded joint. Results show that the microhardness of weld metal (WM) has been increased to over 93.5 HV0.1 after DA treatment, while the microhardness in the T6 welded joint is reduced to 77.0 HV0.1, from 82.0 HV0.1 in the as-welded joint. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the DA treated joint reaches 276.5 MPa, showing an increase of 43.0% compared with as-welded joint. The DA heat treatment of the LPBF AlSi10Mg welded joints effectively improves the hardness and the UTS, which can be mainly attributable to the reduction of the hydrogen pores, the enhancing effect of solid solution strengthening coming from the Si element in the Al matrix and the dispersion strengthening of Si precipitation.

AB Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely considered as a promising material for joint implants but it still has limitations involving high friction and wear. To mimic the cartilage-subchondral bone structure in natural joints, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel layer was fabricated on the PEEK substrate to provide a lubrication mechanism. In addition, tannic acid was applied to form dynamic hydrogen bonds with PVA molecules, for the purpose of strengthening the hydrogel layer and endowing it with self-healing ability. Our experimental results demonstrated that the prepared PEEK-hydrogel composite exhibited good biotribological performance with a low average friction coefficient around 0.06 and little wear after the friction test. It also could repair the scratch made by a blade spontaneously at room temperature taking advantage of the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds. The influence of the properties of the PVA hydrogel and the concentration of tannic acid on the frictional and self-healing behavior of the composite structure was investigated and the internal mechanism was discussed. This work presents a facile method to fabricate a PEEK-hydrogel composite possessing outstanding tribological properties and self-healing capacity simultaneously, hopefully promoting its potential in producing artificial joints.

AB 7N01-T4 aluminum alloy is widely applied to high speed train body material attributed to its excellent comprehensive mechanical properties; however, its high sensitivity to hydrogen stress corrosion would seriously restrict its further application. In this study, the hydrogen-induced stress corrosion of the base metal and the joint was investigated under slow strain rate test to ascertain the characteristics and mechanism of hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking of aluminum alloy. By applying the cathode potential, the morphology of tensile port was studied. Results show that under the action of tensile stress, the free atomic hydrogen produced in the corrosion process or absorbed hydrogen diffuses along the grain boundary into the crack tip region, weakens the grain boundary and causes hydrogen embrittlement, thus accelerating the crack propagation and fracture. These properties provide a broader prospect for the application of 7N01-T4 aluminum alloy in high-speed train body.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative skin preparation with hydrogen peroxide reduces intraoperative culture positivity for Cutibacterium acnes in shoulder arthroplasty.
   Methods: This was a prospective, controlled, parallel/noncrossover, nonrandomized, single-blinded trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov. We included a consecutive series of patients scheduled to undergo primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The first group of patients underwent a standard skin preparation and the second group underwent the same preparation with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. We then took skin, dermis, glenohumeral joint, and air (negative control) aerobic and anaerobic culture swabs. We blinded the laboratory analyzing the samples. An a priori power analysis determined that 56 patients would be needed to see a 50% reduction in culture positivity rates. We also conducted a post hoc gender-stratified analysis.
   Results: Between January 2017 and October 2018, the authors performed 124 primary shoulder arthroplastics, of which we included 65 and collected samples on 61. There were no demographic differences. There were fewer patients within the peroxide group with triple-positive cultures (skin, dermis, and joint) (0% vs. 19%, P = .024) and positive cultures from the joint (10% vs. 35%, P = .031). In our subgroup analysis, these differences were only significant in males. The vast majority of positive cultures were with C. acnes.
   Conclusion: Although larger, randomized studies are needed, adding hydrogen peroxide to the preoperative skin preparation may be a low-cost, low-risk method to reduce deep tissue contamination with C. acnes, particularly within males.

AB Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior and mechanism of E690 welded joint in simulated marine atmosphere containing SO2 were investigated using SSRT method and electrochemical measurements. Results showed that it had very high SCC susceptibility in this environment with a combined mechanism of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The intercritical heat affected zone in the welded joint was the most vulnerable location to SCC because this zone has less strength, more negative potential, and higher corrosion current density. The M-A constituents had a detrimental effect on SCC behavior in the synergetic effect of stress concentration, micro-galvanic corrosion, and HE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The gas tungsten arc-welded 304 stainless steel joints were prepared using two distinct welding parameters (current and welding speed). The evolution of the microstructure, the mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the welded joints were then studied. The results indicate that the microstructure of the welded joints is mainly dendrite, and the main phase's average grain size of base metal (16.36 mu m) is much higher than that of the welded joints (6.61 mu m and 7.14 mu m). Welded joints characterized by higher welding currents and speeds exhibit reduced sensitivity to SCC. Notably, joints under higher welding current and speed significantly enhance corrosion resistance, as evidenced by a lower passive current density (ipass = 4.54 x 10-7 A/cm2), a wide passive range (LIE = 217 mV). Furthermore, the accumulation of chloride ions at stress concentration sites of welded joints contributes to pitting corrosion. This stress concentration at the pitting sites exacerbates anodic dissolution and hydrogen accumulation, ultimately leading to failure.

After hydrogen charging for 2 h, irreversible dome-shaped blisters and internal cracking began to appear on the surface of the base metal. However, after hydrogen charging for 16 h, cracking formed along the thermo-mechanically affected zone boundary, while the blisters or cracking were hardly observed in the stir zone. In addition, the stir zone showed a plasticity reduction from 38% to 28%, much less than that of the base metal reduced from 48% to 2%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes validation of the computational fluid dynamics tool FLACS-Hydrogen. The validation study focuses on concentration and pressure data from vented deflagration experiments performed in 20-foot shipping containers as part of the project Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations (HySEA), funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU). The paper presents results for tests involving inhomogeneous hydrogen-air clouds generated from realistic releases performed during the HySEA project. For both experiments and simulations, the peak overpressures obtained for the stratified mixtures are higher than those measured for lean homogeneous mixtures with the same amount of hydrogen. Using an in-house version of FLACS-Hydrogen with the numerical solver Flacs3 and improved physics models results in significantly improved predictions of the peak overpressures, compared to the predictions by the standard Flacs2 solver. The paper includes suggestions for further improvements to the model system. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrogen distribution in a hydrogen-charged Fe-18Mn-1.2C (wt%) twinning-induced plasticity austenitic steel was studied by Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM). We observed that 1-2 days after the hydrogen-charging, hydrogen showed a higher activity at twin boundaries than inside the matrix. This result indicates that hydrogen at the twin boundaries is diffusible at room temperature, although the twin boundaries act as deeper trap sites compared to typical diffusible hydrogen trap sites such as dislocations. After about 2 weeks the hydrogen activity in the twin boundaries dropped and was indistinguishable from that in the matrix. These SKPFM results were supported by thermal desorption spectrometry and scanning electron microscopic observations of deformation-induced surface cracking parallel to deformation twin boundaries. With this joint approach, two main challenges in the field of hydrogen embrittlement research can be overcome, namely, the detection of hydrogen with high local and chemical sensitivity and the microstructure-dependent and spatially resolved observation of the kinetics of hydrogen desorption.

AB In the present article, we propose a fully coupled thermo-elasto-plastic-damage theory, which includes both kinematic and isotropic hardening, and also accounts for hydrogen diffusion in metals. This theory is based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes under small deformation hypothesis and suppose that hydrogen diffuses in both normal interstitial lattice sites and trapping sites. This model is implemented into Abaqus/Standard by developing a UEL user subroutine and using an "assumed strain" method. A numerical application is performed to simulate hydrogen diffusion in a metallic welded joint submitted to a long-time severe environment at constant temperature.

AB The failure (fracture) mechanism of a welded front axle tube structure made of C45E4 steel from a mini truck was analyzed. The fracture occurred on the right side of the right support frame with the fracture surface perpendicular to the tube axis. SEM examination showed that the fracture surface could be divided into three areas: intergranular area, cleavage area and dimple area. Crack initiation site of the failed front axle tube was at the front weld joint fixing the right support frame on the axle tube. The crack propagated in two opposite directions along the circumference of the tube and converged at the dimple area. Intergranular fracture was found to be in heat affected zone (HAZ). With higher magnification, fine dimples, intergranular and trans-granular fracture characteristics were observed in the crack initiation site. By metallurgical examination, Widmanstatten ferrites, which could decrease the toughness and strength of the weld joint, were observed in the columnar grains. The hardness of HAZ coarse grain area (623 VHN) was far higher than HAZ fine grain area (310 VHN) and base metal (225 VHN). As the weld process indicates, neither pre-weld nor post-weld treatment was carried out. A non-uniform temperature distribution around the weld joint could generate large thermal residual tensile stress in HAZ; thus, the material was very unstable. It could fracture for very small or even no external stress. Hydrogen atoms would be released during welding and microstructures with the highest hardness are the most susceptible of hydrogen assisted cracking. It is concluded that the fracture was caused by hydrogen assisted brittleness under the induction of weld residual stress. Post-weld aging treatment (PWAT) is recommended to release the residual stress generated during welding process. In this case, PWAT was carried out on the failed weld joint and Vickers hardness of HAZ coarse grain area, HAZ fine grain area and base metal decreased to 232 VHN, 205 VHN and 125 VHN, respectively. That indicates that the PWAT procedure could effectively soften the material and relieve residual stress.

For this purpose, under production conditions the change in molten aluminum alloys series 1XXX hydrogen content is analyzed in the main stages from the aluminum electrolyzer to the casting machine. Production operations are determined within which there is significant melt impregnation with hydrogen. Research precision is provided by using a developed procedure for molten sample collection in the main production operations and considering the specific nature of production. Technical solutions are proposed from research results aimed at reducing melt hydrogen expansion.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable energy efficiency and industrial decarbonisation leads researchers from different areas to seek alternative and more effective ways for attaining these goals. A hydrogen economy based on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies is a plausible and promising way to reach the European energy targets and improve the quality of life of society, providing independence and security of the energy supply across Europe. The need for rapid deployment of environment-friendly technologies implies for integrated policy measures and joint efforts of all Member States. This paper gives an overview of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies considering intensively their place in the European policy for decarbonisation and smart growth. The paper also discusses international initiatives in the field and suggests a pathway for greener society.

AB The hydrogen embrittlement of the friction stir welded high carbon steel plates was evaluated by the cathodic hydrogen charging method. The welding was performed below Ac1 transformation point and therefore the stir zone of the welds contained refined ferrite matrix distributed with cementite particles. After hydrogen charging for 4 h, large quantities of irreversible dome-shaped blisters were formed on the surface of the base metal. However, no blisters were observed in the stir zone even after charging for 16 h. In addition, hydrogen-induced internal cracks were formed throughout the thickness of the base metal. But the development of the internal cracks in the base metal was restricted when getting close to the stir zone. The hydrogen charged stir zone showed less reduction of ductility than the base metal during tensile testing, which reveals that the friction stir welded steel joints showed higher resistance to hydrogen embrittelment than base metal.

AB The Pipe-Soil Potentials (PSP) offset of buried metal pipelines caused by geomagnetic storms will threaten the operation safety of hybrid energy transmission pipeline with hydrogen and superconducting cable. It is a critical issue in the planning and design of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipelines. In this paper, based on themechanism of geomagnetic storm invading long-distance buried pipeline, the equivalent circuit model of the pipeline is established using the Distributed Source Transmission Line (DSTL) theory. Then, considering the distance between the insulation joints, radius of the pipeline, coating resistivity, output current of potentiostat, the PSP distribution characteristics of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline under geomagnetic storm is carried out. The interference law of geomagnetic storm on hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline is obtained. Finally, based on the simulation calculation, the optimal design method of hydrogen-electricity hybrid pipeline is acquired considering the geomagnetic interference.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes cartilage damage. Anti-inflammatories are widely used in the management of RA, but they can have side effects such as gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular disorders. Studies published by our group showed that the synthesis of hybrid triazole analogs neolignan-celecoxib containing the substituent groups sulfonamide (L15) or carboxylic acid (L18) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in an acute model of inflammation, inhibited expression of P-selectin related to platelet activation and did not induce gastric ulcer, minimizing the related side effects. In continuation, the present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of these analogs in an experimental model of arthritis and on the functions of one of the important cells in this process, macrophages. Mechanical hyperalgesia, joint edema, leukocyte recruitment to the joint and damage to cartilage in experimental arthritis and cytotoxicity, spread of disease, phagocytic activity and nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages were evaluated. Pre-treatment with L15 and L18 reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, joint edema and the influx of leukocytes into the joint cavity after different periods of the stimulus. The histological evaluation of the joint showed that L15 and L18 reduced cartilage damage and there was no formation of rheumatoid pannus. Furthermore, L15 and L18 were non-cytotoxic. The analogs inhibited the spreading, the production of NO and hydrogen peroxide. L15 decreased the phagocytosis. Therefore, L15 and L18 may be potential therapeutic prototypes to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA.

AB The paper presents a novel numerical approach to the quantitative estimation of the concentration limits for flame acceleration in hydrogen-based mixtures. A series of calculations are carried out for hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen flames in channels. The analysis of the obtained numerical results provided the value of 11 +/- 0.25 % hydrogen content in the mixture as a lean concentration limit of flame acceleration that agrees well with the available experimental data. Moreover, the basic physical mechanism responsible for the transition from the steady mode of flame propagation to the accelerated one is distinguished. The mechanism is related to flame stretching in the region of interaction with the boundary layer and the competition between the joint increase in burning rate and heat losses. The novel technique for the estimation of concentration limits of flame acceleration presented here can be applied to assess combustion conditions inside combustors of energy and propulsion systems fed with hydrogen. The results are also useful in estimating explosion and fire risks in hydrogen storage, transport, and utilization facilities as parts of hydrogen energy and propulsion systems.

ID PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Design of a steel catenary riser requires the use of connection hardware to decouple the large bending moments induced by the host floater at the hang-off location. Reliability of this connection hardware is essential, particularly in applications involving high pressure and high temperature fluids. One option for this connection hardware is the metallic tapered stress joint. Titanium (Ti) Grade 29 has been identified as an attractive material candidate for demanding stress joint applications due to its "high strength, low weight, superior fatigue performance and innate corrosion resistance".(2) Titanium stress joints for deepwater applications are typically not fabricated as a single piece due to titanium ingot volume limitations, thus making an intermediate girth weld necessary to satisfy length requirements. As with steel, the potential effect of hydrogen embrittlement induced by cathodic and galvanic potentials must be assessed to ensure long-term weld integrity. This paper describes testing from a joint industry project (JIP) conducted to qualify titanium stress joint (TSJ) welds for ultra-deepwater applications under harsh service and environmental conditions. Corrosion fatigue crack growth rate (CFCGR) results for Ti Grade 29 flat welding-groove weld (1G/PA) gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) specimens in seawater under cathodic potential and sour brine under galvanic potential are presented and compared to vendor recommended design curves.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the sequential application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline in reducing postoperative infections in TKA. Methods: The study prospectively included 4743 patients, with Group A (2371, 49.9%) receiving sequential intraoperative application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline irrigation of the incision, and Group B (2372, 50.1%) receiving intraoperative application of physiological saline irrigation of the incision only, to collect the patients' baseline data and clinical characteristics, and to statistically assess the incidence of superficial infections and the PJI during the follow up period to evaluate the clinical value of the study. Results: The baseline levels of patients in Groups A and B were comparable. There were 132 (2.8%) lost visits during the study period. The incidence of superficial infections within 30 days after surgery was 0.22% in Group A and 1.17% in Group B, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.007). The incidence of PJI was 0.17% in Group A and 1.26% in Group B, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0121). Conclusion: Sequential application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and physiological saline to irrigate incision in TKA can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative superficial infections and PJI. The scientific and rational application of this therapy intraoperatively greatly reduces the incidence of PJI and postoperative superficial infections, which is of great benefit to the patient's prognosis.

ID RESIDUAL-STRESS
AB The hydrogen assisted cracking susceptibility of Modified 9Cr-1Mo steel weld is evaluated by implant test by determining lower critical stress for different preheating and combination of pre, post heating conditions. The diffusible hydrogen present in the implant specimens for different test conditions is estimated. Residual stress distribution in the weld for different heating condition is estimated using SYSWELD software. For a combination of pre + post heating at 200 degrees C, the diffusible hydrogen content of the weld comes down to 1.17 from 4.7 mL/100g and the lower critical stress of the implant specimen increases from 250 to 370 MPa. Preheating + post heating also brings down the peak tensile residual stress level in the weld joints and lowers the cracking susceptibility.

ID GAS SENSORS
AB The development of reliable hydrogen sensors is crucial for the safe use of hydrogen. One of the main concerns of end users is sensor reliability in the presence of species other than the target gas, which can lead to false alarms or undetected harmful situations. To assess the selectivity of commercial-off-the-shelf hydrogen sensors, a number of sensors of different technology types were exposed to various interferent gas species. Cross-sensitivity tests were performed in accordance with the recommendations of ISO 26142:2010, using the hydrogen sensor testing facilities of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport. Most of the sensor platform tested are unaffected by the exposure to the interferents. The metal-oxide and the thermal conductivity platform show a remarkable sensitivity to CH4. None of the platforms tested were permanently affected by the exposure to the cross-sensitive species. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper examines some specific design issues associated with hydrogen transportation via pipelines based on recent field development study of high-throughput hydrogen pipelines. A mechanical design review is undertaken, and the current design practices and challenge are examined first. An array of key parameters considered to have significant bearing on the hydrogen pipeline general mechanical design are considered and assessed, including out of roundness (OOR) imperfections, combined stress and design factors, thermal gradients, joint mismatch and fabrication, fatigue assessment, installation, specifications and material consideration. Some of these are typically ignored for the conventional pipeline design, but open to rationalization for hydrogen charged pipeline systems subject to material embrittlement risk arising from hydrogen absorption. Complementary to the current design standards and as a spur to discussion on the hydrogen pipeline design analysis, special considerations and recommendations are proposed on materials specification, additional design criteria and construction assessments, and their rationale to mitigate material embrittlement with a view to improving hydrogen pipeline design, reliability and integrity management potentially leading to some tangible cost saving.

AB Martensitic 9% Cr steels like P91 and P92 can show an increased susceptibility to delayed hydrogen-assisted cracking. The focus of this study was the microstructure and heat treatment effect on the mechanical properties of P92 base material and P91 multi-layer weld metal in both as-welded and post weld heat treated (PWHT) condition. Tensile tests with hydrogen-free reference samples and electrochemically hydrogen charged samples were carried out; the mechanical properties were assessed and supported by detailed fractographic analysis. Finally, a hydrogen and microstructure-dependent fracture criterion is established. All investigated microstructures showed a hydrogen-influenced degradation of the mechanical properties compared to the hydrogen-free reference samples. The as-welded martensitic P91 weld metal had the highest degree of degradation in the presence of hydrogen. The P91 PWHT weld metal and the P92 base material had comparable properties. From that point of view, a significantly increased risk for hydrogen-assisted cold cracking during welding fabrication of P91 weld joints must be considered before any heat treatment is conducted.

AB Hydrogen permeation and slow strain rate tests in a high-pressure hydrogen-containing coal gas, combined with microstructural analysis, were conducted on X80 base metal, weld metal, and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ). Variation in the calculated diffusivity from high to low was in the following sequence: CGHAZ, weld metal, and base metal. This result was contrary to those of sub-surface hydrogen concentration and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Hydrogen permeation in CGHAZ decreased the cross-sectional shrinkage by 34.56%, which indicates susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. The co-effects of microstructure, hydrogen diffusivity, and concentration were the main factors that influenced hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INDUCED CRACKING; MICROSTRUCTURE; FRACTURE; DIFFUSION
AB The hydrogen embrittlement behavior in terms of hydrogen-induced surface blistering and hydrogen-induced internal cracking of the friction stir welded high carbon steel plates was evaluated by the cathodic hydrogen charging method. The welding processes were performed at different revolutionary pitches of 0.83, 0.5, and 0.25 mm/rev and therefore, the stir zones of the welds had various microstructures accordingly. After hydrogen charging for 4 hours, the base metal showed large quantities of irreversible dome-shaped blisters on the sample surface. On the contrary, the blisters were hardly observed in the stir zone regardless of the welding parameters and only a small number of microcracks were formed. Compared with the base metal, the stir zones produced at 0.83 mm/rev and 0.5 mm/rev had less ductility reduction after hydrogen charging for the same time. It revealed that the stir zones showed higher resistance to hydrogen embrittlement than the base metal. However, the specimen welded at 0.25 mm/rev showed premature failure after hydrogen charging as a result of the formation of cracks in the twin martensite structure beneath the specimen surface.

AB Periprosthetic joint infection is a leading cause for failure of contemporary total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty projected to nearly double in the next decade and reach an economic burden of $1.85 billion in the United Sates by 2030. Although multiple treatments for periprosthetic joint infection have been described, a thorough de ' bridement and joint lavage to decrease bacterial bioburden and to remove biofilm remains a critical component of treatment. Various adjunct antiseptic agents such as chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and chlorine compounds are currently in off-label use in this capacity. Each antiseptic agent, however, has a distinct mechanism of action and targets different organisms, and some combinations of agents may lead to tissue toxicity. In this review, currently available adjunct antiseptic washes will be described in detail based on their mechanism of action and the evidence for their use will be reviewed. Furthermore, this review puts forward an evidence-based treatment algorithm based on the specific causative organism.

AB The article describes the experimental studies of hydrogen (oxygen) generation processes by the electrolysis method that were fulfilled with the use of the energy plant model involving a solar energy photovoltaic converter (working surface area is of S = 1.5 m(2)) and a membrane-less high-pressure electrolyzer (capacity is of 0.002 m(3) of hydrogen per hour with an operating pressure of 0.3 MPa). Under experimental studies we have adjusted the modes of joint operating the photoelectric converter and the membrane-less high pressure electrolyzer depending on the changes of solar insolation. We have determined the ways to increase the electrolyzer efficiency. It was found that the level of current density, which determines the electrolyzer efficiency by hydrogen, depends on the solar insolation level.

AB Pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6, is an essential cofactor in many biosynthetic pathways. The emergence of PLP-dependent enzymes as drug targets and biocatalysts, such as tryptophan synthase (TS), has underlined the demand to understand PLP-dependent catalysis and reaction specificity. The ability of neutron diffraction to resolve the positions of hydrogen atoms makes it an ideal technique to understand how the electrostatic environment and selective protonation of PLP regulates PLP-dependent activities. Facilitated by microgravity crystallization of TS with the Toledo Crystallization Box, we report the 2.1 A joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of TS with PLP in the internal aldimine form. Positions of hydrogens were directly determined in both the a- and 13 -active sites, including PLP cofactor. The joint XN structure thus provides insight into the selective protonation of the internal aldimine and the electrostatic environment of TS necessary to understand the overall catalytic mechanism.

AB Rock wettability and pore fluid properties are critical parameters for evaluating shale reservoirs, enhancing oil recovery, sequestering waste, and storing energy. Multiple petrophysical and geochemical experiments are routinely used to characterize these properties of shales. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)based shale evaluation methods usually rely on T1/T2 difference in various fluids. However, T1/T2 value is inadequate for petrophysical characterization due to the similar T1/T2 value of different hydrogen types in shales. A brand-new characteristic parameter, T1/T2 variation during a solvent extraction experiment, is proposed for the characterization of shale petrophysical properties. The theoretical ranges of T1/T2 variation for different hydrogen components were determined from the type and content changes of hydrogen during extraction based on surface relaxation model. Joint experiments of multi-step solvent extraction and NMR T1-T2 were designed to validate the theoretical results. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the heterogeneity of shale is responsible for the different hydrogen components with a similar T1/T2 value. The results of joint experiment (1) show that the T1/T2 variation ranges for different hydrogen components are different, and (2) indicate that T1/T2 variations can be used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrogen type and saturation. The experimentally determined ranges and patterns of T1/T2 variation are consistent with the theoretical results. The quantitative relationship between T1/T2 variation and saturation, mobility, or wettability was further determined based on the theoretical variation of correlation time. Finally, a new interpretation scheme was established for the quantitative evaluation of wettability and fluid properties based on T1/T2 variations.

AB In the framework of the HyTunnel-CS European project sponsored by Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (CH JU), a number of tests were conducted in a full-scale tunnel in France. These tests are devoted to safety of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles having a compressed gas storage. The goal of the study is to develop recommendations for Regulations, Codes and Standards (RCS) for inherently safer use of hydrogen vehicles in enclosed transportation systems. Two sets of tests have been performed, (a) five tests with compressed hydrogen tanks, (b) two tests with compressed helium tanks. The hydrogen gas pressure varied between 47 bar and 610 bar. The blast wave overpressures are recorded together with fireball characteristics. The obtained experimental data are compared to existing engineering correlations and it is confirmed that not only the mechanical energy of compressed gas but also a fraction of chemical energy contribute to the blast wave strength.

AB Methods of optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy have been used to study the structure of welded joints of a high-strength structural steel with different types of the weld metal. The impact toughness of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) has been determined at temperatures of +20 and -40A degrees C. Based on the fractograph investigations of the character of the fracture of the welded joints after tests for impact bending, the regions that are the most dangerous for crack initiation have been determined. Structural factors that affect the brittleness of the near-weld zone of welded joints with the austenite metal of the weld are indicated, including the existence of an austenite-bainite structure and coarse carbides, as well as the specific distribution of hydrogen.

AB Hydrogen energy applications often require that systems are used indoors (e.g., industrial trucks for materials handling in a warehouse facility, fuel cells located in a room, or hydrogen stored and distributed from a gas cabinet). It may also be necessary or desirable to locate some hydrogen system components/equipment inside indoor or outdoor enclosures for security or safety reasons, to isolate them from the end-user and the public, or from weather conditions.
   Using of hydrogen in confined environments requires detailed assessments of hazards and associated risks, including potential risk prevention and mitigation features. The release of hydrogen can potentially lead to the accumulation of hydrogen and the formation of a flammable hydrogen-air mixture, or can result in jet-fires. Within Hyindoor European Project, carried out for the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking safety design guidelines and engineering tools have been developed to prevent and mitigate hazardous consequences of hydrogen release in confined environments. Three main areas are considered: Hydrogen release conditions and accumulation, vented deflagrations, jet fires and including under-ventilated flame regimes (e.g., extinguishment or oscillating flames and steady burns). Potential RCS recommendations are also identified. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen sulfide dissolved in aqueous electrolyte solutions causes susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in most structural steels. This is one of the reasons for failure of the oil and gas field equipment and occurrence of the emergency situations. When transporting media containing hydrogen sulfide, most of the damage occurs in the welded joint area. In this study, the authors have established the influence of the microstructure of individual sections of the weld metal, its heat-affected zone, and the base metal on the corrosion resistance of a welded joint of a low-alloy pipe steel (grade X70) in the environment that mimics the operating conditions of the main oil and gas pipelines in the High North regions. The temperature fields and thermal cycles were calculated for submerged multi-arc welding in order to simulate the microstructure of the most problematic areas with the reduced level of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The method of controlled resistive heating and subsequent cooling was used to simulate the welding process. The simulation of the welding thermal cycle was performed using the Gleeble 3800 complex for physical simulation of thermomechanical processes. The results of sulfide stress cracking tests are presented. A metallographic analysis and microhardness measurements of the welded joint areas and base metal were carried out. It was shown that the microstructure of the overheated areas in the heat-affected zone is the part of the welded joint that is most susceptible to sulfide stress cracking. It has been established that studying just the welded joint and the base metal for susceptibility to corrosion cracking is insufficient in terms of assessing the reliability of a welded joint, which indicates the need to revise the testing procedure. In this study, samples of welded joints of thick-walled large-diameter pipes, including the base metal, heat-affected zone, and fusion zone, were studied. The areas that are most susceptible to the formation of corrosion cracks were determined and simulated.

AB We report the crystal structure of the anhydrous form of pranoprofen, a valuable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, solved by direct space methodologies from synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. Through a detailed joint experimental and computational study we have explored the complex interplay of aromatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions present in the molecular arrangement of pranoprofen in the solid state. Cooperativity and reinforcement of pi-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions govern the singular crystal packing of pranoprofen, suggesting potential binding mechanisms with biological targets.

ID PIPELINE STEEL; BEHAVIOR; PROTECTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; HYDROGEN; JOINT
AB This study systematically investigates the electrochemical characteristics and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility of distinct microstructural zones (base metal (BM), heat-affected zone (HAZ), and weld metal (WM)) in S420 steel welded joints under cathodic polarization potentials through combined electrochemical characterization and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) testing. Results demonstrate that HAZ exhibits the highest corrosion current density among the three zones, indicating enhanced anodic dissolution and consequent SCC promotion. All zones display similar electrochemical responses to potential variations, with charge transfer resistance initially increasing then decreasing as polarization potential shifts negatively, peaking at -850 mV where anodic reactions dominate. SCC susceptibility progressively intensifies with cathodic polarization, transitioning from mixed anodic dissolution/weak hydrogen embrittlement (HE) at -750 mV to HE-dominated failure at -950 mV. The superior SCC susceptibility of HAZ is attributed to its coarser grain structure and abundant pearlite bands, yielding a hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility coefficient of 39.1 % at -850 mV - significantly higher than WM (19.3 %) and BM (16.0 %).

AB XOFs-type materials (X=M, C, S, that is, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks, respectively) share a common unifying feature: mutual spatial orientation of constituting components is strictly directional and unchanging by design. Herein, we illustrate an alternate design for porous architectures, as rigid joints constituted by coordinative (MOFs), covalent (COFs), or hydrogen-donor/acceptor (SOFs) bonds, are replaced by supramolecular ball joints, which confer unprecedented flexibility, especially angular, to porous networks. The obtained frameworks remain highly organized but are also permutable: lacking a forced convergence towards an immutable minimum energy structure, these systems remain able to adjust depending on external conditions. Results of POF (permutable organized framework) synthesis is a family of structures rather than a single pre-determined three-dimensional arrangement, as we demonstrate with an illustrative set of 5 XRD structures.

AB The joint consideration of hydrogen supply chain networks and electric power systems can promote hydrogen-fueled transportation and the penetration of renewable energy. This paper develops a low-carbon scheduling approach for an Integrated Hydrogen Transport and Energy System (IHTES). To reduce carbon emissions, the environmental cost from the hydrogen supply chain network and electric power system is jointly minimized with the operational cost of IHTES. To consider the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries, hydrogen transport via tube trailers is innovatively modeled as an extended vehicle routing problem with time windows, and delays are penalized. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem so that it can be efficiently solved using the branch-and-cut method. Case studies illustrate and validate the proposed model, and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach. Carbon emissions are reduced by 47.8% when the emission cost is co-optimized with the operational cost. The operational cost of the hydrogen supply chain network is reduced by 7.3% when the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries is modeled.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB In order to achieve carbon neutrality in a few decades, the clean energy proportion in power mix of China will significantly rise to over 90%. A consensus has been reached recently that it will be of great significance to promote hydrogen energy, that is produced by variable renewable energy power generation, as a mainstay energy form in view of its potential value on achieving carbon neutrality. This is because hydrogen energy is capable of complementing the power system and realizing further electrification, especially in the section that cannot be easily replaced by electric energy. Power system related planning model is commonly used for mid-term and long-term planning implemented through power installation and interconnection capacity expansion optimization. In consideration of the high importance of hydrogen and its close relationship with electricity, an inclusive perspective which contains both kinds of the foresaid energy is required to deal with planning problems. In this study, a joint model is established by coupling hydrogen energy model in the chronological operation power planning model to realize coordinated optimization on energy production, transportation and storage. By taking the carbon neutrality scenario of China as an example, the author applies this joint model to deploy a scheme research on power generation and hydrogen production, interregional energy transportation capacity, and hydrogen storage among various regions. Next, by taking the technology progress and cost decrease prediction uncertainty into account, the main technical- economic parameters are employed as variables to carry out sensitivity analysis research, with a hope that the quantitative calculation and results discussion could provide suggestion and reference to energy-related companies, policy-makers and institute researchers in formulating strategies on related energy development.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB In recent years, metal-thermoplastic polymer hybrid joints have been widely used in lightweight advanced aircraft and new energy vehicles. In this work, the method of machine milling + FeCl3 corrosion + coating KH892 was used to construct a viscous bionic villi structure on the surface of A2024 aluminum alloy, which greatly improved the interfacial bonding strength of a 30-wt.% glass fiber-reinforced PET-A2024 aluminum alloy joint (expressed as 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 joint). The synergistic action of the millimeter column produced by milling and the micron-scale porous structure produced by corrosion results in multiscale mechanical interlocking and increases the interfacial bonding strength of 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 to 44.2 MPa, which is 13.7 times greater than that of untreated joint. FTIR results show that the KH-892 coating can change the viscosity of the villi surface, which makes it easier for the bionic villi surface to bond with PET. Under the action of millimeter-micron multiscale mechanical interlocking and multiple hydrogen bonds, the interfacial bonding strength of 30-wt.% GF/PET-A2024 increases to 54.8 MPa.

AB Hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) with onsite hydrogen production systems, which are usually composed of electrolyzers, hydrogen storage tanks and fuel cells, not only supply hydrogen for hydrogen-powered vehicles but also serve as a dispatchable technology that can bid in electricity markets. Except partici-pating in energy market, joining in reserve market can compensate the cost in energy market and in-crease the total revenue of HFS. This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic programming model to find the optimal offering strategy of the HFS in energy, reserve markets taking into account a series of un-certainties: day-ahead price, secondary reserve price, system imbalance price and hydrogen demand. Nonanticipativity constraints are employed to guarantee the decisions are made according to the realized uncertainty information up to the present stage. Compared with traditional stochastic programming model, the proposed model adequately considers the sequential bidding decisions with the gradual revealing of the uncertainty over time. Numerical experiments based on one case study indicate that the participation of reserve market greatly increase the revenue of HFS. In addition, the proposed multi-stage stochastic programming model is effective in characterizing the sequential decision. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) following shoulder arthroplasty are a major source of morbidity and are most commonly caused by Cutibacterium acnes, a bacteria found concentrated in the dermis. Skin preparation using hydrogen peroxide has been shown to reduce positive cultures; however, direct application to the dermis has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the application of hydrogen peroxide to the dermis affects the incidence of positive C acnes cultures.
   Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty by a single fellowship trained surgeon was performed between February and November 2020. Enrolled patients were randomized to either receive standard skin preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis with or without an additional application of hydrogen peroxide to the dermis following incision. Culture samples were taken from the skin, dermis, glenohumeral joint, and air. Laboratory personnel and patients were blinded to randomization, and all cultures were held for 14 days. Culture positivity rate along with culture site, day of culture positivity, and bacterial abundance of positive cultures were analyzed. Stratified analysis by gender and age of <69 years was also performed.
   Results: Sixty patients undergoing primary arthroplasty were randomized. The group receiving hydrogen peroxide (n = 30) and the control group (n = 30) were similar in age (71.1 +/- 7.1 vs. 73.4 +/- 9.8; P = .30), body mass index (29.4 +/- 5.7 vs. 28.5 +/- 6.0; P = .57), gender (P = .64), hand dominance (P = .65), and surgery type (P = .90). The overall rate of at least 1 positive culture was 18%. All positive cultures were C acnes. The positive culture rate in the hydrogen peroxide (20%) and control group were similar (16%; P > .99). There were no positive glenohumeral joint cultures and no wound complications. There was no significance difference in the culture site, day of culture positivity, and bacterial abundance. Stratification analysis by gender and age also demonstrated similar rates of C acnes between study groups.
   Conclusion: Standard skin preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis results in an overall low rate of skin and dermis culture positivity.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement of a precipitation-hardened Fe-26Mn-11Al-1.2C (wt.%) austenitic steel was examined by tensile testing under hydrogen charging and thermal desorption analysis. While the high strength of the alloy (>1 GPa) was not affected, hydrogen charging reduced the engineering tensile elongation from 44 to only 5%. Hydrogen-assisted cracking mechanisms were studied via the joint use of electron backscatter diffraction analysis and orientation-optimized electron channeling contrast imaging. The observed embrittlement was mainly due to two mechanisms, namely, grain boundary triple junction cracking and slip-localization-induced intergranular cracking along micro-voids formed on grain boundaries. Grain boundary triple junction cracking occurs preferentially, while the microscopically ductile slip-localization-induced intergranular cracking assists crack growth during plastic deformation resulting in macroscopic brittle fracture appearance.

AB Injection molded direct joining (IMDJ) is a promising metal-plastic direct joining method to make products lighter. IMDJ first treats the metal surface and then injects melted plastic onto the surface via injection insert molding. In this study, the chemical interaction between metal and plastic was discussed with aluminum plates whose surface textures and chemical conditions were carefully controlled. The different joining strengths for these different chemical conditioned plates indicated that the chemical interaction existed between aluminum and polyamide 6 (PA6). We characterized the joint interface with AFM-IR. The IR spectrums change indicated that -CONH in PA6 formed the hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl groups on the aluminum surface. The chemisorbed water on the surface was suspected to undermine the formation of the hydrogen bond. Our study showed that the hydrogen bond existed and contributed to the joining strength, which provided a better understanding of the joining mechanisms.

AB The joint microenvironment contributes significantly to arthritis by shaping the synovial sheath and inducing cartilage damage. Hydrogen has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential and shows promise in the treatment of arthritis, particularly in selectively reducing free radical levels while preserving normal cell redox reactions. However, the short retention time of hydrogen and its low solubility in body fluids pose challenges for its use to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Smart biomaterials respond to alterations in physiological parameters and external stimuli, enabling precise targeting and continuous local treatment, thus maintaining local H2 concentration at the treatment site. In this review, the recent advances in hydrogen-producing nanomaterials for the treatment of arthritis are presented and the challenges and prospects for their clinical application are evaluated.

In order to reduce the costs of wind power, the joint probability method is applied in the joint design of marine environmental elements. Based on copulas and univariate maximum entropy margins, multivariate maximum entropy distributions are constructed. Sample data of annual maximum significant wave height and corresponding wind speed and current velocity at Point 2 in Lianyungang Harbour of China is applied to testify the efficiency of trivariate maximum entropy distributions. The marginal fittings of univariate maximum entropy distributions and the trivariate data fitting based on normal copula fit the data well.

AB The hydrogen supply system is the high-pressure section of fuel cell system, consisting of many valves, pipelines and joints. A hydrogen leak may occur due to the reduced sealing performance or crash accidents. Therefore, a quick and accurate hydrogen leakage detection method is essential to support hydrogen safety. The traditional multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method directly classifies the hydrogen leakage fault according to the hydrogen concentration. However, using hydrogen concentrations at local points to describe leak fault severity has significant limitations. A novel hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning is proposed to classify hydrogen leak rate. The hydrogen leakage simulations are performed to form the database containing a series of hydrogen leakage scenarios. The sensor placement is optimized and the features extracted from hydrogen concentration time series are selected by applying ReliefF algorithm. The model -based hydrogen leakage detection method is analyzed and fused with proposed hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning by applying decisionlevel fusion algorithm. Compared with traditional multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method, the detection time of proposed multisensor -based hydrogen leakage detection method is shorter under nearly 80% of all scenarios. The classification accuracy of the proposed hydrogen leakage detection method based on Stacking ensemble machine learning and model -based hydrogen leakage detection method is 92.1% and 93.5%, respectively. The probability of class is increased and classification accuracy can be improved through D-S evidence theory.

AB Renewable hydrogen is a promising alternative to increase the presence of renewable energy in hard-to- decarbonize economic sectors. Renewable-fuel regulation standards have been formalizing to ensure that on-grid electrolytic production is primarily powered by renewable electricity. This work evaluates the mid- and long-term impact of integrating renewable hydrogen supply chains into the expansion and operation of the power system using a tailored modification of the open-source energy modeling system (OSeMOSYS). The model optimizes the joint expansion of the Chilean power system and a hydrogen supply chain for exports, between 2025 and 2060, under the European standard for renewable hydrogen. Results show that incorporating renewable hydrogen supply chains that comply with this standard impacts the infrastructure and operation of the power system during its transition towards decarbonization. Between 2025 and 2040, the off-grid hydrogen production scenario results in distributed production, requiring internal hydrogen transport and low grid reliance. Conversely, a scenario that assumes Power Purchase Agreements for renewable electricity results in centralized hydrogen production, with higher electricity transmission investments and grid reliance. For the scenarios studied, the average systemic cost of hydrogen production ranges from $2.9/kgH2 to $6.4/kgH2.

ID OPERATION
AB To address the increasing hydrogen demand and carbon emissions of industrial parks, this paper proposes an integrated energy system dispatch strategy considering multi-hydrogen supply and comprehensive demand response. This model adopts power-to-gas technology to produce green hydrogen, replacing a portion of gray hydrogen and incorporates a carbon capture system to effectively reduce the overall carbon emissions of the industrial park. Meanwhile, incentive-based and price-based demand response strategies are implemented to optimize the load curve. A scheduling model is established targeting the minimization of procurement, operation, carbon emission, and wind curtailment costs. The case study of a northern industrial park in China demonstrates that the joint supply of green and gray hydrogen reduces carbon emissions by 40.98% and costs by 17.93% compared to solely using gray hydrogen. The proposed approach successfully coordinates the economic and environmental performance of the integrated energy system. This study provides an effective scheduling strategy for industrial parks to accommodate high shares of renewables while meeting hydrogen needs and carbon reduction targets.

AB For our works, Mass Exchangers (MEs) are membrane equipment that exchange some component between two streams in a countercurrent arrangement. In previous works these were proposed to use them (with the goal of hydrogen recovery, energy saving and waste minimization) at different stages of the hierarchical decision procedure for process synthesis by Douglas: at an early design stage, when deciding the recycle structure of the process (resulting in considerable changes in the process structure); or at a final design stage, before deciding the mass and energy integrations of process streams (resulting in minor changes in the process structure).
   The heuristic allocation of MEs was used independently at both design stages in previous works, with the goal of comparing with other design alternatives reported in the literature that use membranes in the conventional configuration (one feed stream and two exit streams; retentate and permeate). In contrast, the present work compares the results of using MEs, when they are used individually at both design stages, and when they are used jointly at both design stages, in different configurations. For the case study example (the HDA Process), the use of a ME at an early design stage reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 3.37%, and the recycle compressor power by 4.09%. The use of a ME at a final design stage reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 31.64%, but it does not reduce the recycle compressor power. The joint use of the MEs at both design stages reduces the fresh hydrogen consumed by 14.54%, and the recycle compressor power by 2.91%.
   The joint use of MEs at both design stages retains the principal benefits of its use at early and final design stages (energy saving and hydrogen recovery, principally), so when both a reduction in the fresh hydrogen consumed and in the recycle compressor power is desired, it is the most appropriate option.

AB Hydrogen enrichment induced by pipeline welding residual stress is a key issue affecting the safe service of hydrogen pipelines. In order to explore the influence of welding residual stress on hydrogen diffusion and the effect of heat treatment, an X80 pipeline model with a six-layer girth weld was established using ABAQUS software, and coupling analysis of temperature field, stress field, and hydrogen diffusion was carried out. The distribution of residual stress in the welding area and local inclusion area was analyzed, the relationship between the hydrostatic stress and hydrogen diffusion of the pipeline, and the influence of the direction and shape of the inclusion on hydrogen diffusion were explored, and the effect of post-weld heat treatment on the residual stress and hydrogen diffusion in the welding area and local inclusion area was studied. The hydrostatic stress curve is similar to the hydrogen concentration distribution curve, and hydrostatic stress can be considered the main driving force for hydrogen diffusion in the pipeline. As the angle between the inclusions and the hydrogen diffusion direction increases, the hydrogen diffusion flux will gradually decrease. The more slender the inclusions, the stronger the diffusion ability of parallel or 45 & DEG; inclusions, and the weaker the diffusion ability of perpendicular inclusions. Hydrogen enrichment occurs in inclusions or inclusion boundaries before and after post-weld heat treatment of the pipeline, and the internal hydrogen concentration of hard inclusions is higher than that of soft inclusions. Post-weld heat treatment can significantly reduce welding residual stress and hydrostatic stress, thereby reducing hydrogen enrichment concentration.

AB Hydrogen is considered a key alternative to fossil fuels in the broader context of ecological transition. Repurposing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transport is one of the challenges of this approach. However, hydrogen can diffuse into metallic lattices, leading to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). For this reason, typically ductile materials can experience unexpected brittle fractures, and it is therefore necessary to assess the HE propensity of the current pipeline network to ensure its fitness for hydrogen transport. This study examines the relationship between the microstructure of the circumferential weld joint in X52 pipeline steel and hydrogen concentration, introduced electrolytically. Base material, heat affected zone and fused zone were subjected to 1800, 3600, 7200 and 14400 s of continuous charging with a current density J = -10 mA/cm2 in an acid solution. Results showed that the fusion zone absorbed the most hydrogen across all charging times, while the base material absorbed more hydrogen than the heat-affected zone due to the presence of non-metallic inclusions. Fracture toughness was assessed using single edge notch tension specimens (SENT) in air and electrolytic hydrogen. Results indicate that the base material is particularly vulnerable to hydrogen environments, exhibiting the greatest reduction in toughness when exposed to hydrogen compared to air.

DE Carbon equilibrium; decarbonization; electrolytic hydrogen; integrated
   electricity-hydrogen system
ID POWER-TO-HYDROGEN; STORAGE
AB Global carbon emissions from electricity and hydrogen production have grown rapidly in recent years. Some existing literature has proposed the method of reducing carbon emissions by power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology. However, due to the fossil-based energy structure of electricity system, excessive electricity to hydrogen may lead to an increase in carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions effectively, a low carbon-driven optimal capacity configuration method for P2Hs is proposed in this paper to explore carbon equilibrium in integrated electricity-hydrogen system. A joint economic dispatch model for integrated electricity-hydrogen system is formulated. The electricity system model is a security-constrained economic dispatch model with P2H constraints. The hydrogen system model is a hydrogen supply chain model with pipeline pack constraints and Weymouth equation, whose sources are fossil fuel reforming and electrolytic hydrogen. We propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based solution to transform the hydrogen system model into a mixed integer second order cone programming (MISCOP), which can be readily solved by commercial solvers. To preserve the internal information of each system, a decentralized algorithm based on optimality condition decomposition (OCD) is developed. Case study based on modified IEEE 30-bus and Belgium 20-node integrated energy system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Optical and electronic properties of ZnO doped with interstitial hydrogen were investigated using density functional theory approach. The stable position of H+ was determined in ZnO lattice. Hydrogen doping has increased the band gap of ZnO and shifted the Fermi level into the conduction band, revealing the so-called Burstein-Moss effect which is in consistent with some experimental results. Charge density calculation and Bader analysis showed that there is a strong bond between H and O while H doping intersects bond of Zn-O and increases charge of jointed oxygen, finally decreases volume of supercell. The optical calculations show that hydrogen incorporation, increases the optical band gap and plasma frequency, thus it shifts the absorption edge to lower wavelength, which leads to a blue shift.

AB Hydrogen therapy is an emerging and highly promising strategy for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. However, nonpolarity and low solubility of hydrogen under the physiological conditions results in a limited therapeutic effect. Herein, we develop a biocompatible magnesium micromotor coated with hyaluronic acid as a hydrogen generator for precise rheumatoid arthritis management. The hydrogen bubbles generated locally not only function as a propellant for the motion but also function as the active ingredient for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation scavenging. Under ultrasound guidance, the micromotors are injected intra-articularly, and the dynamics of the micromotors can be visualized. By scavenging ROS and inflammation via active hydrogen, the oxidative stress is relieved and the levels of inflammation cytokines are reduced by our micromotors, showing prominent therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating joint damage and suppressing the overall arthritis severity toward a collagen-induced arthritis rat model. Therefore, our micromotors show great potential for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and further clinical transformation.

AB The joint effect of temperature and strain rate on hydrogen embrittlement properties of martensitic steel was investigated. At 50 & DEG;C, the elongation loss first increases and then, decreases with decreasing the strain rate. It was firstly reported that at the low strain rates, hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility was mitigated by temperature due to an increase in the hydrogen effusion to the surface of the material and the release of a significant amount of hydrogen before the yield point by temperature effect. At 25 & DEG;C, elongation loss increase with decreasing the strain rate, since in lower strain rates, the hydrogen can interact with mobile dislocations, which finally leads to H-induced fracture. The Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship between martensite and austenite was established, and prior austenite EBSD micrographs were obtained. The intergranular crack was observed which can be related to acting prior austenite grain boundaries as an H-induced crack path.

AB Hydrogen as compressed gas is a promising option for zero-emission fuel cell vehicle. The fast and efficient refueling of high pressure hydrogen can provide a convenient platform for fuel cell vehicles to compete with conventional gasoline vehicles. This paper reports the finding of adiabatic simulation of the refueling process for Type IV tank at nominal working pressure of 70 MPa with considering the station refueling conditions. The overall heat transfer involved in refueling process was investigated by heat capacity model based on MC method defined by SAE J2601. The simulation results are validated against experimental data of European Commission's Gas Tank Testing Facility at Joint Research Centre (GasTef JRC), Netherlands. The results confirmed that end temperature and state of charge significantly depends on refueling parameters mainly supply hydrogen temperature and filling rate.

AB This study investigates the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of bare and Co coated AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel/YSZ ceramic reactive air brazed joints achieved by Ag-CuO braze for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolysis Cells applications. Interfacial microstructure of steel/YSZ joints is analyzed by SEM and TEM with EDS. A thick and porous oxide layer rich in Fe, Cr, and Cu is found in bare steel/YSZ ceramic joints, which is induced by the severe oxidation and its intense reaction with CuO during the brazing process. For the coated steel/YSZ ceramic joint, a comparably dense and uniform (Co, Fe, Cu)(3)O-4 spinel layer is formed on the steel surface, which is tightly bonded with Ag-CuO braze without visible bonding defects. Meanwhile, the oxidation of steel substrates and its interaction with CuO is significantly suppressed. Co coated steel/YSZ joints possess reliable mechanical properties with the shear strength of 51 MPa, which is 54.5% higher than that of bare steel/YSZ ceramic joints (33 MPa). Besides, the microstructure evolution of coated steel/YSZ ceramic joints during brazing is schematically illustrated by a physical model. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Investigation results are presented to improve the structural strength (cold crocking resistance) of weld joints in high-strength steels with the yield limit over 600 MPa. The effect of arc, laser, and hybrid laser-arc welding conditions on the weld metal structure and diffusion hydrogen saturation of build-up and fused base metals was experimentally studied. The diffusion hydrogen saturation of build-up (arc and hybrid welding) and fused (laser welding) metals was chromatographically examined. In gas-shielded arc welding, the diffusion hydrogen content in the fused base metal was shown to be limited to the concentration that does not exceed 0.4 ml/100 g due to an increase in the welding speed from 18 to 50 m/h. In laser and hybrid laser-arc welding of high-strength steels with the yield limit over 600 MPa, the diffusion hydrogen content in the fused metal makes up 0.07 and 0.2-0.3 ml/100 g, respectively, regardless of the welding speed. The cold cracking resistance was evaluated by a commonly accepted procedure of special reference butt samples. Optical and transmission microscopic studies permitted of revealing the effect of arc, laser, and hybrid laser-arc welding conditions on the weld metal structure and gaining detailed information on the dislocation density distribution. The relation between the level of local internal stresses and the structural factors of dislocation density distribution in the weld metal was established. In arc and laser welding, local internal stresses were shown to be reduced to the values that do not exceed 0.22 of the theoretical metal strength if the welding speed would make up 50 m/h. In hybrid laser-arc welding at 72-110 m/h, maximum local internal stresses are also less than 0.22 of the theoretical metal strength. An increase in the cold cracking resistance in butt weld joints of high-strength 14KhGN2MD and N-A-XTRA-70 steels was established to be reached due to a low concentration of diffusion hydrogen in fused metal and formation of the fine-grained structure of lower bainite with the uniform dislocation density distribution.

AB We investigate the constraints on the reionization history of the Universe from a joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background and neutral hydrogen fraction data. The tanh parametrization and principal component analysis methods are applied to the reionization history respectively. The commonly used tanh parametrization is oversimplistic when the neutral hydrogen fraction data are taken into account. Using the principal component analysis method, the reconstructed reionization history is consistent with the neutral hydrogen fraction data. With the principal component analysis method, we reconstruct the neutral hydrogen fraction at z = 9.75 as x(HI) = 0.69(-0.30)(+0.32) for 6 < z < 20 range reconstruction, and x(HI) = 0.76(-0.22)(+0.27) for 6 < z < 30 range reconstruction. These results suggest that the Universe began to reionize at redshift no later than z = 10 at a 95% confidence level.

AB Polymer modification is a promising approach to improve the joining performance of injection molded direct joining (IMDJ) technology. However, the factors contributing to the improved joining strength of submicron scale surface pattern joints have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism for improving the joining performance of polyamide 6 (PA6)/aluminum alloy A5052 joints with Blast + hot water treated metal structure using a flow modifier (OSGOL MF-11). Enhanced mechanical polymer infiltration at the submicron scale was confirmed, and the hydrogen bond generation at the joint interface was characterized. These findings elucidate the reason for the joining performance improvement caused by the flow modifier in the submicron scale.

AB With growing concern about risks related to energy security around the world, the development of hydrogen cooperation between India and Japan has become very important to ensure the economic security of the two countries and to deepen economic cooperation. This report covers both public and private initiatives in the hydrogen area in both countries and visualizes the high potential and potential areas where both countries could cooperate in the hydrogen area, as well as the challenges that are necessary for cooperation. The following four factors are strong incentives for India and Japan to deepen cooperation in the hydrogen field: (1) India has a high potential hydrogen supply capacity, (2) India is very active in implementing hydrogen in society, (3) Japan is already conducting R&D in areas of high interest to India and (4) Japan will need to import hydrogen from other countries in the future. The issues of (1) cost visualization, including transportation costs, (2) harmonization of regulations, (3) harmonization of promotion measures between the two countries, (4) definition of "green hydrogen," and (5) protection of intellectual property are main challenges to be overcome. Thus, disclosures of necessary data for cost visualization of hydrogen transportation, further inter-governmental cooperations between India and Japan, and facilitation of the discussions on hydrogen among various stakes are key actions for materializing various joint hydrogen projects between both countries.

AB The effect of NaOH-containing fine water mist on hydrogen explosion flames is investigated utilizing numerical simulations using a multi-step model of the chemical reaction mechanism. The suppression effect of hydrogen explosion fine water mist in different pipes is studied. The chemical agent NaOH is introduced into the water mist, and the inhibition mechanism is studied from a microscopic perspective. The results show that the addition of fine water mist can effectively reduce the flame temperature and that the fine water mist completely evaporates and absorbs heat in the preheating zone. The addition of NaOH can improve the inhibition effect of ultrafine water mist on hydrogen explosion, which is the result of the joint action of physical inhibition and chemical inhibition. The mole fraction curve shows that NaOH delays the reaction process of hydrogen explosion by trapping high-energy free radicals.

AB Green hydrogen is a potential contributor to a more sustainable transportation system. In this paper, we present our experiences and insights gained from an industrial-scale green hydrogen refilling station, marked by the innovative hybrid Edge-Cloud electrolyser system (EMS) employed in this context. Hybrid EMS can improve system performance, adapt to dynamic conditions, and continuously improve efficiency, even under unpredictable load and low storage situations. It also allows the centralized monitoring of future hydrogen production sites to facilitate the operation and maintenance and, in the long-term vision, to enable the joint coordination of the plants flexibilities in the service market as a virtual plant, thus increasing the cost efficiency. Through a real-time digital-model based assessment of the EMS, this study offers valuable lessons learned and findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of EMS in green hydrogen infrastructure.

AB Road transportation is a significant source of CO2 emissions and energy demand. Conse-quently, initiatives are being promoted to decrease the sector's emissions and comply with the Paris agreement. This article synthesizes the available information about heavy-duty fuel cell trucks as their deployment needs to be considered a complementary solution to decreasing CO2 emissions alongside battery electric vehicles. A thorough evaluation of 95 relevant documents determines that the main research topics in the past ten years converge on public policies, hydrogen supply chain, environmental impact, drivetrain technology, fuel cell, and storage tank applications. The identified research gaps relate to expanding collaboration between institutions and governments in developing joint green macro policies focused on hydrogen heavy-duty trucks, scarce research about hydrogen production energy sources, low interest in documenting hydrogen pilot projects, and minimal involvement of logistic companies, which need to plan their diesel freight's conversion as soon as possible.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Novel microporous activated carbon (MAC) with high surface area and pore volume has been synthesized by microwave heating. Iron oxide nanoparticles were loaded into MAC by using Fe(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O followed by microwave irradiation for up to five minutes. The surface modified microporous activated carbon was characterized by BET, XRD, SEM and thermogravimetric examinations. Adsorption data of H-2 on the unmodified and modified MACs were collected with PCT method for a pressure range up to 120 bar at 303 K. Greater hydrogen adsorption was observed on the carbon adsorbents doped with 1.45 wt% of iron oxide nanoparticle loaded due to the joint properties of hydrogen adsorption on the carbon surface and the spill-over of hydrogen molecules into carbon structures.

AB The synergistic effects of Nd and Ga on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ER4047 alloy wires and the resulting MIG(Melt inert-gas welding) joints were investigated. Experimental results show that the hydrogen content in the liquid and solid alloy decreases rapidly and then increases slowly with the addition of Nd in the range of 0-0.8 wt.%. Under the same conditions, the hydrogen content ratio in the solid and liquid is between 1.9 and 2.1. After adding 0.08-0.2 wt.% Nd, the alpha-Al dendrites and eutectic Si phases in the ER4047 alloys are refined and modified, respectively; the quality index of the cast rod increases and the weld percent porosity of the MIG joint significantly decreases. However, when 0.8 wt.% Nd is added, although the size of the eutectic Si phase reaches a minimum value, a large number of coarse needle-like Nd-rich phases precipitate in the structure. Moreover, Ga inhibits the precipitation of the Nd-rich phases, thus improving the mechanical properties, especially the elongation of the cast rod. When 0.2 wt.% Nd and 0.05 wt.% Ga are added into the alloy wire, the porosity of the MIG joint reaches the lowest value herein, and the tensile strength and face/back bending angles reach their maximum values.

AB Surgical site infections (SSIs) and prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) remain significant challenges in orthopedic surgery, particularly in joint arthroplasty. Intraoperative irrigation is a widely used strategy for infection prevention, yet traditional solutions such as saline, povidone-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite are limited by cytotoxicity, short antimicrobial duration, and poor biofilm penetration. This review evaluates commonly used irrigation agents and highlights the growing evidence supporting a novel citrate-based solution as a potentially superior alternative. These agents combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, effective biofilm disruption through ionic chelation, and prolonged postoperative protection with minimal harm to host tissues. Early clinical studies and ongoing randomized trials have demonstrated promising results, including reductions in postoperative swelling, opioid use, and infection rates. As more data become available, citrate-based solutions may emerge as the preferred standard for intraoperative irrigation in orthopedic procedures.

AB Gas-geochemical studies of the methane, helium, and hydrogen concentrations in the water of thermal and mineral springs, as well as the subsurface atmosphere, of northern Vietnam showed that the region is in the hypabyssal degassing zone of hydrogen and helium flowing to the surface through a fault system in the Earth's crust. A joint transit of these gases through the fault structures was established. Distribution pattern of hydrogen and helium concentrations in the Red River Rift area (northern Vietnam) was obtained from the extensive gas and water sample data. Intense linear anomalies are associated with the Red River Rift and the Dien Bien regional rift. Seismic events are associated with the fault, and earthquake epicenters are located in the Dien Bien Province.

AB It has been established that the noble-metal-H analogue has been found in a large number of noble-metal-ligand clusters in view of geometric and electronic structures. Here, we demonstrated a different view of noble-metal-H analogue between noble-metal and hydrogen in M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag, Au and H) systems. Although H(SCH3)(2)(-) is a typical ion-hydrogen bonding cluster dramatically different from the chemical bonding clusters of M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag and Au), the comparison of the two typical bonding patterns has not yet been fully investigated. Through a series of chemical bonding analyses, it is indicated that the evolution has been exhibited from typical ionic bonding in Cu(SCH3)(2)(-) to a significant covalent bonding nature in Au(SCH3)(2)(-) and hydrogen bonding dominating in H(SCH3)(2)(-). The comparison of M(SCH3)(2)(-) (M = Cu, Ag and Au) with H(SCH3)(2)(-) illustrates the differences in bonding between noble metals and hydrogen, which are mainly related to their diverse atomic orbitals participating in chemical bonding.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB High silicon aluminum alloy is a kind of high-performance electronic packaging material, due to its excellent thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, and low density. The heat affected zone (HAZ) of conventional welding techniques is too wide to weld the high silicon aluminum alloy, as wide HAZ will improve risk of cracking. Laser welding with narrow HAZ, high joint strength, and good morphology, has been considered as a promising method to weld high silicon aluminum alloy. Herein, the surface morphology, microstructure, and microhardness of laser welding joint between Al-50wt.%Si and Al-27wt.%Si alloys were investigated. It has been found that welding speed at 3 mm-5 mm/min can significantly reduce the hydrogen pores and cracks in laser welding joints. Also, the key paraments of laser welding to control the quality of joints are power and pulse width, while the former one is mainly controlling the joint width and the latter one is significantly changing the joint depth. Along the horizontal direction of laser welding joints, the microhardness increases firstly and then decreases, with the highest microhardness of 167 HV in the weld zone. Because the laser welding method could produce uniform microstructure of joints, the microhardness of joints is uniform along the longitudinal direction. The tensile properties of welding samples are almost the same with the properties of the Al-50wt.%Si base materials.

AB Background: The prevention and treatment of periprosthetic joint infection is of utmost importance to orthopedic surgeons. Irrigation solutions have become a popular additive to the prevention and treat-ment armamentarium. Methods: This symposium summarizes the mechanism of action, basic science, and clinical research to date on the use of irrigation solutions. The four most commonly used irrigation solutions, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and acetic acid, are discussed. In addition, the role of antibiotic powers is reviewed. Results: Each solution has its risks and benefits that must be weighed by the surgeon. There is no clear irrigation solution that is superior. The role of additive antibiotic powder (vancomycin) remains controversial. Conclusion: More rigorous prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal irrigation solution for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic joint infection.

The lap-shear testing results show that a mixed failure dominated by adhesive failure occurred in both unexposed and exposed adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints. The lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints declined sharply in the preliminary stage of NSS exposure (e.g. shorter than 240 hours), then it decreased moderately as the NSS exposure time increased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and electrochemical noise measurement were applied to exploring the degradation mechanisms of the lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints. The adhesive properties remained nearly unchanged after exposure in the NSS environment. The decreased hydrogen bond at the AA5052/adhesive interface was responsible for the sharp degradation of the lap-shear strength of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints in the preliminary stage of NSS exposure. In the later stage of NSS exposure (e.g. more than 240 hours), the surface oxidation of AA5052 substrates dominated the lap-shear strength degradation of adhesive-bonded AA5052 joints.

AB In the present investigation, the electrochemical behavior of dissimilar welds between austenitic stainless steel and low-carbon steel obtained by resistance spot welding was investigated. The results obtained showed the formation of martensite in the fusion zone produced elevated hardness values (similar to 480 HV) and was detrimental to the corrosion resistance of the material in acid media (0.5M H2SO4 containing naturally dissolved O-2). The susceptibility of the welded joints to hydrogen embrittlement was studied by applying cathodic charging in acid solution, which led to a 42 +/- 5% reduction in maximum elongation compared to noncharged specimens.

AB The effects of the formation of hydrogen-bonded networks on the important osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are explored in a joint Raman spectroscopic and electronic structure theory study. Spectral shifts in the experimental Raman spectra of TMAO and deuterated TMAO microsolvated with water, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol are compared with the results of electronic structure calculations on explicit hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters. Very good agreement between experiment and theory suggests that it is the local hydrogen-bonded geometry at TMAO's oxygen atom that dominates the structure of the extended hydrogen-bonded networks and that TMAO's unique stabilizing abilities are a result of the "indirect effect" model. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) calculations further reveal that hyperconjugation results in vibrational blue shifts in TMAO's C H stretching region when solvated and a red shift in methanol's C-H stretching region when hydrogen bonding with TMAO.

AB A reduction in greenhouse gases has become an inescapable requirement. An effective scenario for achieving carbon neutrality is to develop a hydrogen economy. Its success, however, requires strict control of the different processes involved in planned hydrogen chains. The energy chain considered in this paper is a stationary application which involves the production of hydrogen by electrolysis (a power-to gas process) and its combustion in gas turbine combined cycles to generate electricity (a gas-to-power process). In such applications, the need is twofold: (i) to control the risk of explosive atmospheres by performing safe gas detection in the presence of hydrogen and (ii) to secure the reliability of all chain processes using hydrogen-rich gases by achieving reliable analyses of these gases. This paper is dedicated to the development of hydrogen energy to decarbonize the thermal production of electricity. We will first describe the hydrogen chain that would best suit the power generation sector. Then, we will highlight the properties of hydrogen that are critical for its reliable operation. Finally, we will review the sensing technologies suitable for hydrogen-containing fuels. This review paper was published as part of a Joint Industrial Project (JIP) aimed at enabling the safe and reliable deployment of hydrogen energy.

AB Compared to the conventional hydrogen bonds, nonconventional hydrogen bonds have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work, we firstly investigate hydrogen bonds in mixed-solvent Au-(CH3OH)(H2O) complex via gas phase anion photoelectron velocity map imaging associated with quantum chemical calculations. The vertical detachment energy of Au-(CH3OH)(H2O) complex is determined as 3.22 +/- 0.02 eV. The calculations reveal these mixed-solvent solvated complexes having two stable low-energy isomers: Iso-a and Iso-b. And the experimental spectrum is ascribed to the contribution from Iso-a isomer. Detailed hydrogen bonding patterns have been revealed for both isomers.

AB X52 pipeline steel has been widely used for long-distance transmission for oil and gas, there is a lack of evaluation of such pipelines steel in service. Thus, the present work mainly focuses on the effect of cathodic protection potential on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of a in service for 20 years X52 pipeline steel. The SCC behavior was systematically studied by electrochemical method, slow strain rate tension (SSRT), and surface analysis techniques in near-neutral NS4 solution. The results show that the SCC mechanism of base metal (weld joint) belongs to the anodic dissolution, anodic dissolution + hydrogen embrittlement, and hydrogen embrittlement when the E-app is - 664 mV (- 738 mV), - 664-- 872 mV (- 738-- 980 mV), and < - 872 mV (- 980 mV), respectively. The SCC susceptibility of base metal and weld joint gradually increases with the negative potential application and then increases sharply when the potential is negative than - 1100 mV. The fracture morphology also changes with the E-app and gradually becomes cleavage fracture with the negative shift of potential.

AB This study examines the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of A500 bulletproof steel joints welded with austenitic stainless steel (ER371) and ferritic (T91) filler materials. While austenitic fillers are traditionally used in bulletproof steel welding to prevent cracking and hydrogen embrittlement, their lower hardness creates a potential weakness in welded joints. This research explores an alternative approach using a newly developed ferritic filler material to achieve strength matching with the base material. Detailed microstructural characterization was conducted using Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), while mechanical properties were evaluated through tensile testing, impact testing, and hardness measurements. The results revealed significantly different mechanical behaviors between the two filler materials, with the ferritic filler achieving superior weld metal hardness (470 HV1) compared to the austenitic filler (185 HV1) in WZ. The fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) exhibited the highest hardness (518 HV1) in A500-T91 joints and (480 HV1) in A500-ER371 joints, while ballistic testing demonstrated enhanced penetration resistance with the ferritic filler material.

AB Given the high sensitivity of hydrogen porosity in the welding process of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy formed by selective laser melting, the effect of dehydrogenation treatment on the pore defects of alloy laser welded joints was analyzed by solid solution dehydrogenation and vacuum solid solution dehydrogenation methods under different states as well as the pore distribution, microstructure evolution, and mechanical behavior of laser welded seam. The results show that the solution treatment can effectively reduce the porosity of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy laser welded seam formed by selective laser melting. Vacuum solution treatment has the best effect, which reduces the porosity from 2.646% of the deposited state laser welding seam to 0.14%. The reasons for the appearance of pores were explained by analyzing the evolution of the joint structure and change in the phase morphology and composition of the substrate. It is revealed that vacuum heat treatment is an effective method to solve the problem of pore formation in the weld due to the high content of hydrogen pre-existing in the substrate. After solid solution, the hardness of the base metal decreases significantly, and the average hardness (HV) of the welds of each test plate is 784 MPa, which is relatively consistent. The tensile strength of the welded joint of the solid solution test plate is 143 MPa, which is lower than that of the deposited joint, but the elongation increases to 24%, showing characteristic of ductile fracture.

AB In recent years, a large and growing number of companies have attempted to develop core technologies for their products by conducting joint research with a company in a different industry. However, the mechanisms by which technologies are acquired and assimilated through cross-industry research remains unclear. In response to this ambiguity, we developed a theoretical framework for this mechanism, proposed hypotheses, and empirically examined data from a joint research project conducted by Toyota Motor Corporation and Panasonic Corporation to develop the nickel-hydrogen storage cell. Specifically, we analysed networks of inventors who filed patent applications through the joint research. The results indicate that there are 'boundary mediators' who facilitated the exchange of technologies between the two companies. On the basis of their wide range of technical knowledge, we found there to be two types of boundary mediators.

AB The characteristics of electrolyte wetting and gas release are of vital importance for the electrocatalytic activity of a hydrogen evolution electrode (HEE). Herein, we reported a strategy to synergistically optimize the electrolyte wetting and gas release of a HEE to enhance its electrocatalytic activity. In our work, Pt nanosheets arrays were electrochemically deposited on a conductive substrate of Au microgrid to form a HEE. The micropores of Au grids induced discontinuous solid/liquid two-phase contact lines in microscale, which facilitated the wetting of proton-contained electrolyte. Simultaneously, the superaerophobicity of HEE promoted the release of hydrogen gas products. The joint improvement on electrolyte wetting and gas release enhanced the current density of hydrogen evolution reaction at a high overpotential by similar to 300 % when compared with Pt nanosheets arrays on a flat Au substrate.

AB The stress corrosion behavior of 7085-T7452 high-strength aluminum alloy base material (BM) and its friction stir welding (FSW) joints under varying strain rates during slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) was investigated. The results show that the stress corrosion sensitivity (ISSRT) of both the BM and FSW joints decreases with the increase of strain rate from 10-7 s- 1 to 10-5 s- 1. Moreover, the BM demonstrates lower ISSRT than the joints. The cracks in the joints exhibit dendritic paths along grain boundaries, with evidence of crack arrest marking (CAM) at localized areas in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, suggesting both anodic dissolution and hydrogen-induced cracking simultaneously govern the propagation of stress corrosion cracks. There is the forced more test time in the slower strain rate, and the accumulation of stress corrosion coupling damage accelerates with the time, eventually leading to the greater degradation in the stress corrosion resistance and the higher ISSRT.

AB Fatigue tests of cruciform welded joints made of Q355B steel at very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) regimes were carried out on as-welded specimens using high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment in dry air and water-spray environments, respectively. The influence of the environment on fatigue life was more obvious in the VHCF regime. It was found that S-N curves became flat over the range of 10(6)-10(8) cycles for as-welded specimens, while a continuously decreasing S-N curve existed for HFMI-treated specimens. Fatigue cracks initiated from the weld toe of the as-welded specimens in dry air and water-spray environments. Due to residual stress, the crack initiation site transition of HFMI-treated specimens from the weld toe to the weld root and base metal was observed at lower stress levels. Moreover, hydrogen-assisted quasi-cleavage and intergranular fracture were captured using a scanning electron microscope and a hydrogen permeation test.

AB Using fiber laser welding technology, X80 pipeline steel welded joints with different welding heat inputs were obtained. Their microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance (in NACEA solution saturated with hydrogen sulfide) were studied. Findings indicated that with the increase in heat input, the proportion of ferrite, strength, elongation, and corrosion resistance increased within a certain range and the sum of the proportion of martensite and bainite and hardness decreased. The heat input has a greater effect on the microstructure of weld metal (WM) and coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), while that of fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) is basically unchanged. Obvious differences are also found in the corrosion resistance of different regions of the welded joints, among which FGHAZ has the strongest corrosion resistance, followed by WM and CGHAZ. The heat input mainly affects the microstructure type of the welded joint to affect the corrosion resistance. Therefore, we model the heat input as a function of R-ct and i(corr) from this relationship. In addition, the corrosion products film produced by the long-term immersion of the welded joint in the saturated H2S NACEA solution can hinder the development of corrosion and enhance the corrosion resistance to a certain extent.

AB The equipment of RH600 Hydrogen Analyzer (Fusion) was adopted to measure the hydrogen content of Nb47Ti alloy bars, with Phi 50 mm X 40 mm after different annealing processes in RX-460 electric furnace. Based on the analysis results, a dehydrogenation method was proposed. The results indicate that the main hydrogenation takes place at the annealing temperature of 1200 degrees C, while the hydrogenation can not occur in the subsequent annealing at 950, 930 and 900 degrees C. The hydrogenation phenomenon occurring in Nb47Ti alloy is mainly attributed to the joint effect of the high activity constituent elements and the rare hydrogen atmosphere. The 800 degrees C/3 h and 800 degrees C/6 h vacuum heat treatment can reduce the hydrogen content in Nb47Ti alloy effectively from 60 mu g/g to 21 and 29 mu g/g, respectively.

AB The present study deals with the effects of high temperature expositions and subsequent cathodic hydrogen charging of dissimilar martensitic/bainitic weldment on its local mechanical properties and fracture behaviour at room temperature. Circumferential welded joint under investigation was produced by tungsten inert gas welding of X10CrWMoVNb9-2 martensitic and 7CrMoVTiB10-10 bainitic steels tubes with Ni-based filler metal and the application of subcritical postweld heat treatment. Hardness profile measurements revealed pronounced hardness peaks in over-heated regions of the individual steels heat-affected zones which remained preserved also during subsequent expositions at 600 degrees C for up to 5000 hours. Gradual microstructural degradation of these regions included precipitate coarsening and the formation of new secondary phases during thermal exposure. The combined effects of thermal and hydrogen embrittlement of the studied weldment resulted in deleterious effects on its tensile and fracture behaviour.

ID ENERGY SYSTEM
AB The proliferation of hydrogen fueling stations as a critical infrastructure is necessary for the successful materialization of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Such fueling stations can, in part, utilize the renewable/inexpensive electricity, which would otherwise be curtailed, to generate and store hydrogen. The stored hydrogen can later be used to serve the transportation sector and straightforwardly yield profit for the operator of the stations. The available energy in the storage stations, however, would not be utilized effectively during offpeak hydrogen demand by the transportation sector. While hydrogen fueling stations are primarily contemplated as the suppliers to hydrogen vehicles, this paper shows how the storage capacity in each station can be exploited to provide operating reserve (OR) to an electricity market. To that end, this paper proposes a new supervisory-based model for the optimal scheduling of distributed hydrogen storage stations for 1) energy supply to hydrogen-powered vehicles; and 2) OR provision to an electricity market. As such, the economic feasibility of the investment in such stations would be further intensified due to extra financial settlements for the stations via joint applications. This paper, then, unveils a model that brings about more opportunities for the deployment of hydrogen fueling stations, thereby further inspiring the private investment in such an area by private sectors. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are validated using numerical illustration conducted on a test system.

AB The effects of height reductions and microstructure inhomogeneity on hot deformation behavior of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.%H Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy welded joints were investigated. The hydrogen-induced evolution mechanisms of flow stress were discussed. The results show that fully lamellar microstructures were stretched or bent with increasing height reductions, the inhomogeneity had no significant effect on microstructure evolution at a small height reduction. The hydrides had occurred local fracture and a large angle bending at height reduction of 60%. The morphology of DRX grains tended to change from approximate equiaxed to large lamellar with increasing hydrogen content to the 0.21 wt.%H. Flow stress decreased significantly with increasing hydrogen content, but height reduction had a limited effect on flow stress evolution. Flow stress of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.%H weld zone was larger than that of base metal at height reduction of 60%, the 0.21 wt.%H could not significantly improve hot working performance of the weld zone. The hydrogen-induced dynamic recrystallization of alpha lamellas and improved dislocation movement resulted in the rapid reduction of flow stress with the 0.21 wt.%H. The limited increase of beta phase and local stress concentration also finitely led to a slight decrease of flow stress.

AB Nickel yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anode (Ni-YSZ)/interconnect joints with silver palladium gallium (Ag-9Pd-9Ga) active fillers are prepared by vacuum brazing. The joint structure and microstructure are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEWEDS), and by using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). SEM observations of the joint show no cracks near the interface, confirming the compatibility of the Ag-9Pd-9Ga filler with a different anode and interconnect. The XRD pattern of the joint specimens oxidized at 800 degrees C for 250 h shows Cr2O3 and (Mn,Cr)(3)O-4 surface layers. EPMA analysis of the cell/Ag-9Pd-9Ga/alloys joint at the cross section shows Cr, O, Fe, Zr, Ni, Ag, Pd, Ga, Y, and Mn. Overall, the results indicate that the bonding between metal and cermet is well established and the interface is smooth. By correlating the XRD and EPMA analysis results, we also analyzed the possible stages during joint oxidation. The joint strength was evaluated at 25 and 800 degrees C under shear and tensile loading conditions, respectively, and the brazed Ag-9Pd-9Ga sealant compared favorably with the commercially available glass-ceramic GC-9 counterpart.

AB This paper summarises the first results from the joint industry project (JIP) 'Risk-reduction for hydrogen installations by partial suppression of explosions' (HyRISE). The main objective of the project is to develop fundamental knowledge that can support the development of practical solutions for mitigating hydrogen explosions in congested and confined environments by means of active systems for chemical inhibition. The aim is not to extinguish the incipient flame, but rather to lower the reactivity of the fuel-air mixture prior to ignition, and thereby reduce the consequences of an accidental explosion to a tolerable level. The paper consists of three parts: a review of previous work on chemical inhibition of premixed hydrogen-air flames, simulations with the chemical kinetics software Cantera, and experiments conducted in a 20-litre explosion vessel. The results demonstrate that chemical inhibition can be effective for hydrogen-air mixtures. However, it remains to develop efficient inhibitors and practical systems that can be implemented in industrial facilities, with satisfactory performance over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations.

AB High-nitrogen austenitic stainless steel (HNASS) has many excellent properties, such as high strength and toughness, high strain-hardening ability, strong corrosion resistance and low magnetization compared with the traditional widely used Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steel. The high nitrogen content in HNASS leads to the welded joint in the risk of many problems, such as nitrogen escape and loss, nitride precipitation, formation of pores and thermal cracks, resulting in the poor welding performance. The HNASS joints without obvious defects were obtained by metal inert gas (MIG) welding and laser-MIG hybrid welding, separately. The microstructures and properties of welded joints were compared. The nitrogen content in fusion zones of the two joints was tested by an oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen analyzer. The tensile strength and the impact absorption energy of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint were about 27% and 20% higher than those of MIG welded joint, respectively. It could be attributed to the stronger solid solution strengthening effect resulted by the high nitrogen content of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint. The finer grains and the reduction of ferrite and precipitation phase in the microstructure of laser-MIG hybrid welded joint contributed to the improvement of toughness. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB The increasing penetration of renewable and distributed resources signals a global boom in energy transition, but traditional grid utilities have yet to share in much of the triumph at the current stage. Higher grid management costs, lower electricity prices, fewer customers, and other challenges have emerged along the path toward renewable energy, but many more opportunities await to be seized. Most importantly, there are insufficient studies on how grid utilities can thrive within the hydrogen economy. Through a case study on the State Grid Corporation of China, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of grid utilities within the hydrogen economy. Based on these factors, we recommend that grids integrate hydrogen into the energy-as-a-service model and deliver it to industrial customers who are under decarbonization pressure. We also recommend that grid utilities fund a joint venture with pipeline companies to optimize electricity and hydrogen transmissions simultaneously.

AB The presence of microstructural heterogeneity within welded joints, combined with environmental factors, can have detrimental effects on the service life of engineering structural components. This study explores the effect of hydrogen/methane (H2/CH4) gas mixture under various volume fractions of hydrogen on the deformation and fracture behavior of a welded API X70 pipeline material employing the small punch test method. The welded metal showed more vulnerable to hydrogen-assisted fracture in comparison to the base metal, as evinced by a notable reduction in the volume fraction of hydrogen required for the transition from ductile to brittle behavior. The hydrogen embrittlement indexes obtained through the small punch test method are more severe than those obtained through conventional test methods. The direct utilization of small punch test results for the assessment of hydrogen compatibility in structural materials may yield overly conservative estimations. Quantitative parameters derived from the small punch test of both materials, along with fracture morphologies, were analyzed to establish a correlation between the hydrogen embrittlement indexes obtained through the small punch test and those obtained through conventional test methods. The small punch test method appears capable of detecting hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity resulting from adverse microstructural features existing in the metal matrix.

AB This paper proposes a systematic optimization framework to jointly determine the optimal location and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage in a power network to achieve the transition to lowcarbon networks efficiently. We obtain these strategic decisions based on the multi -period alternating current optimal power flow (AC MOPF) problem that jointly analyzes power network, renewable, and hydrogen storage interactions at the operational level by considering the uncertainty of renewable output, seasonality of electricity demand, and electricity prices. We develop a tailored solution approach based on second -order cone programming within a Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. In a test case, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen storage and consideration of the AC MOPF model significantly reduces the operational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide quantitative insights to decision -makers on how to integrate renewable sources and hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price, renewable curtailment cost, emission tax price, and conversion efficiency.

AB The corrosion-fatigue behavior of X65 welded joints, processed by cold metal transfer (CMT) and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) backing, was examined. The application of the CMT backing process led to a 22% increase in the corrosion-fatigue performance, which was attributed to the optimization of the microstructure (synergistic cracking-arrest ability of acicular ferrite (AF) and grain boundary ferrite (GBF)) and the reduction in the stress concentration at the weld root. Nonetheless, a lower heat input contributed to a consequent decrease in corrosion-fatigue performance. In addition, H2S corrosion fatigue was governed by the combined effect of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Mining equipment made of welded metal structures is strongly affected by the corrosion phenomenon due to the working conditions. Initial research has shown that the corrosion phenomenon is most pronounced in the area of cross-welded joints and welded T-shaped joints. In the researches, there was made a chemical analysis of the welded construction material used respectively of the new material and it was observed a reduction in carbon concentration in the material used, but also a substantial increase in the sulfur concentration compared to the new material. The pronounced corrosion of the metallic structure is influenced by the chemical composition change because the sulfur is a grafitizing and weakening element, and the decrease in carbon concentration causes a decrease in corrosion resistance. Also, the pronounced corrosion is due to the action of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elements that are present in the working environment of welded constructions. In order to achieve a reduction in the corrosion phenomenon, it is very important that the welded joints are made using the optimal parameters of the welding regime so as to obtain metallographic structure with finer granulations.

AB Reducing carbon dioxide emissions during production is one of the main trends in modern oil and gas chemistry. One of the most realistic possibilities for achieving this is to involve carbon dioxide generated in technological processes as a feedstock for producing gas chemical products. The maximum effect can be achieved in the production of large-scale chemicals, such as syngas, hydrogen, and methanol. We consider such possibilities and present a new combined autothermal process for the joint production of hydrogen and methanol based on non-catalytic matrix conversion of natural gas into syngas, which allows one to almost avoid CO2 emissions.

AB Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is a common joining method for austenitic stainless steel sheets. Edge joint is frequently used configuration when the aim is to produce weldments e.g., between the tube sheets and the tubes and to other hollow structures needing tight sealing welds and sound joints. In those applications all positions for welding is usually needed. Robotized welding is utilized, when manual welding is not possible, e.g., in maintenance for nuclear power applications. In automatic welding a strict control of location of arc and welding parameters are extremely important.
   In this work the aim was to find suitable welding parameters, as pulse parameters, welding speed and shielding gas composition and study their effects on weld joint penetration and weld quality in different welding positions. In addition, the inaccuracy in the alignment of the arc and its effects was tested in different cases. It was found that it was possible to find the optimal parameters in different positions, flat (PA), overhead (PE), and vertical-up position (PF). However, the vertical-down position (PG) was giving a lower joint penetration in the cases which allow sound welds. Therefore, it was considered that the fabrication of the circumferential joint was best done in two steps to avoid the PG position, which ensures that a sound weld with the set 2.6 mm penetration requirement is achieved over the entire circumference. The use of a shielding gas mixture containing argon and 2% hydrogen showed significant advantages over the other three shielding gas compositions tested, which was observed as deeper penetration of the welds.

AB Assessing the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of circumferential welds of pipelines with pore defects in gaseous hydrogen environments contributes to the safe operation of hydrogen-blended pipelines. A three-dimensional finite element model coupling defectmechanics-hydrogen diffusion was developed in this study to determine the variation of hydrogen concentration in both lattice and trap sites in the pore region, influenced by pore defect location, size, and cyclic loading frequency. Results show that the distribution of the hydrogen atom concentration at lattice sites resembles the distribution of hydrostatic stress and distribution at trap sites resembles the distribution of plastic strain. Most hydrogen atoms reside in lattice sites rather than dislocation traps. The hydrostatic stress and plastic strain in the pore region change with the pore location due to the constraint conditions during the welding process. The hydrogen atom concentration in pore region at WL-4 and WL-5 (i.e., the filling layers) is relatively high, making these regions susceptible to hydrogen-induced cracking. The strain level at pore defects increases significantly with pore size, accompanied by a rise in hydrogen concentration at trap sites. When the pore diameter is 1 mm, the hydrogen concentration in the pore region reaches its peak level. Even smaller pore defects (with diameter is 0.7 mm) can result in hydrogen enrichment. Cyclic internal pressure reduces the hydrostatic stress level and total hydrogen concentration in the pore region. Under fluctuating internal pressure, low-frequency loading poses the greatest threat to the structural integrity and hydrogen embrittlement resistance of pipeline joints.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is rapidly gaining ground as a physiological mediator of inflammation, but there is no clear consensus as to its precise role in inflammation. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of ATB-346 as a novel H2S-releasing naproxen compared to naproxen, as a traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on zymosan induced mono-arthritis in rats.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=48) were randomly assigned to four main groups: normal control, untreated arthritis, Naproxen and ATB-346 treated groups. Mono-arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of zymosan into the knee joints. Mechanical hypernociception and joint swelling were evaluated at 6 hours and 5 days. Inflammatory cellular recruitment and adherence, tumor necrosis factor alpha, nuclear factor kappa beta, total sulfide levels, and histological changes were evaluated in knee lavages, blood or joint tissues at selected time points.
   RESULTS: Zymosan injection evoked knee inflammation and pain as characterized by mechanical hypernociception, impaired gait, joint swelling with inflammatory exudation and histological changes. Treatment with ATB-346 attenuated nociceptive responses, inflammatory cellular and biochemical changes in comparison to naproxen. Only ATB-346 was able to suppress neutrophil adherence and to preserve normal articular structure.
   CONCLUSIONS: H2S releasing naproxen represents an advancement over the parent drug, naproxen. Apart from the superior anti-inflammatory and anti-noceiceptive activity, ATB-346 offered a distinguished chondroprotective effect and is almost devoid from naproxen deleterious effects on articular cartilage

AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the effect of galvanic corrosion on the sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) of X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay by altering the cathode/anode area ratios, Na2S2O3 concentrations and temperatures.Design/methodology/approachThe effects of galvanic corrosion on X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay SSCC were investigated by immersion test, galvanic corrosion current test, electrochemical measurement, four-point bending experiment, hydrogen permeation experiment and scanning electron microscopy.FindingsThe anodic dissolution of the fusion boundary was enhanced as the cathode/anode area ratio increased, which is necessary for the SSCC of the X80/Inconel 625 weld overlay. However, severe galvanic corrosion reduced the SSCC susceptibility. The SSCC susceptibility showed a linear increase with Na2S2O3 concentration in the range of 10-4 similar to 10-2 mol/L. However, further increasing the Na2S2O3 concentration to 10-1 mol/L resulted in the disappearance of SSCC. This is likely because sufficient hydrogen was required for SSCC initiation even under severe anodic dissolution conditions, which was further supported by the reduced SSCC susceptivity at elevated temperatures.Originality/valueLimited studies aim to establish the relationship between the galvanic corrosion and SSCC of welded joints through altering the cathode/anode area ratios, Na2S2O3 concentrations and temperatures. This work will pave the way for understanding the effect of galvanic corrosion on the SSCC of dissimilar weld joints.

AB This study investigates the local strain rate characteristics on the OH layers in the stabilization region of hydrogen syngas turbulent non-premixed jet flames near blowoff. Simultaneous measurements of planar laserinduced fluorescence of OH radicals and particle image velocimetry were involved to obtain the velocity fields and reaction zone thicknesses. The blowoff behaviors are characterized across two regimes: low fuel jet velocity (Regime I) and high fuel jet velocity (Regime II). In Regime I, flame blowoff is primarily governed by lean flammability limits at the rim wake, whereas in Regime II, it is driven by high strain rates and scalar dissipation near the nozzle exit. A joint analysis of the mean velocity field and averaged OH-PLIF images was performed, and a joint probability density analysis of the flow field characteristics and OH thickness properties extracted from the instantaneous fields was also conducted. The result show that flames with higher hydrogen content exhibit greater resistance to blowoff due to higher strain rates in the reaction zone. The statistical distribution of strain rates and OH thickness provides insights into local extinction phenomena, indicating that scalar dissipation plays a crucial role in determining blowoff limits.

AB Casein kinase 2 (CK2) has broad phosphorylation activity against various regulatory proteins, which are important survival factors in eukaryotic cells. To clarify the hydration structure and catalytic mechanism of CK2, we determined the crystal structure of the alpha subunit of human CK2 containing hydrogen and deuterium atoms using joint neutron (1.9 angstrom resolution) and X-ray (1.1 angstrom resolution) crystallography. The analysis revealed the structure of conserved water molecules at the active site and a long potential hydrogen bonding network originating from the catalytic Asp156 that is well known to enhance the nucleophilicity of the substrate OH group to the Upsilon-phospho group of ATP by proton elimination. His148 and Asp214 conserved in the protein kinase family are located in the middle of the network. The water molecule forming a hydrogen bond with Asp214 appears to be deformed. In addition, mutational analysis of His148 in CK2 showed significant reductions by 40%-75% in the catalytic efficiency with similar affinity for ATP. Likewise, remarkable reductions to less than 5% were shown by corresponding mutations on His131 in death-associated protein kinase 1, which belongs to a group different from that of CK2. These findings shed new light on the catalytic mechanism of protein kinases in which the hydrogen bond network through the C-terminal domain may assist the general base catalyst to extract a proton with a link to the bulk solvent via intermediates of a pair of residues.

AB The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential of hydrogen obtained from renewable sources for energy generation and storage systems. The first part of analysis will address such issues as various methods of green hydrogen production, storage and transportation. The review of hydrogen generation methods will be followed by the critical analysis and the selection of production method. This selection is justified by the results of the comparative research on alternative green hydrogen generation technologies with focus on their environmental impacts and costs. The comparative analysis includes the biomass-based methods as well as water splitting and photo-catalysis methods while water electrolysis is taken as a benchmark. Hydrogen storage and transportation issues will be further discussed in purpose to form the list of recommended solutions.
   In the second part of the paper the technology readiness and technical feasibility for joint hydrogen applications will be analysed. This will include the energy storage and production systems based on renewable hydrogen in combination with hydrogen usage in mobility systems as well as the stationary applications in buildings such as combined heat and power (CHP) plants or fuel cell electric generators. Based on the analysis of the selected case studies the author will discuss the role of hydrogen for the carbon emission reduction with the stress on the real value of carbon footprint of hydrogen depending on the gas source, storage, transportation and applications.

AB In this study, micro -scale cellular and nano -scale labyrinth structures were obtained on the surface of A2024 aluminium alloy adherends through ultrasonic -aided corrosion using an FeCl 3 etchant solution to significantly enhance the mechanical interlock of it and a 30 -wt.% glass -fibre -enhanced polyethylene terephthalate substrate. The tensile shear strength of the 30 -wt.% GF/PET-A2024 joint was increased to 31.84 MPa. The subsequent treatment of an appropriate amount of KH-892/PVA transformed the surface of the aluminium alloy from hydrophobic to hydrophilic to significantly improve its wettability. Furthermore, this treatment generated multiplex hydrogen bonding of O-H & ctdot; O & ctdot; H-N at the interface, further improving the tensile shear strength of the joint up to 50.94 MPa, which is significantly higher than the values obtained using exiting methods. The tensile shear tests of a ring -shaped insulator specimen according to GB 7251-87 verified the improved fracture work equation herein and the bonding strength enhancement of the 30 -wt.% GF/PET-A2024 aluminium alloy joint treated by ultrasonic -aided corrosion with an FeCl 3 etchant solution and pre -coating of an appropriate amount of KH-892/ PVA.

AB The article presents an experimental study on the corrosion resistance of the 3003 Aluminium alloy Friction Stir Welded (FSW) joint in different working environments. Three types of corrosive media at different temperatures were tested to see how they affected the FSW joint mechanical properties. The media were sodium chloride, hydrogen chloride, and ethylene glycol. In parallel with the study of the effect of temperature, static tensile tests were carried out on specimens taken perpendicular to the welding direction. Also, micro-hardness profiles were used to determine the influence of the parameters studied on the various weld zones. Finally, the effect of the most aggressive corrosive medium, temperature, and the inclusion of ethylene glycol on the crack propagation resistance of an FSW joint were studied. Fatigue-propagation tests at constant stress amplitude were carried out to understand what affects the fatigue crack propagation of welded joints after corrosive attack. The results showed that uniform and pitting corrosion were combined to cause FSW joint surface degradation. Corrosion damage does not appear to alter yield strength and ultimate stress values. However, FSW joints show a significant degradation in mechanical properties with increasing temperature and with the aggressiveness of the corrosive medium. The inclusion of ethylene glycol was found to delay the rate of crack propagation during testing, leading to an improvement in the service life of pre-corroded FSW joints.

AB In an integrated power-hydrogen distribution system (IPHDS), on-site hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) with photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery energy storage systems, electrolyzers (ELs), fuel cells, and hydrogen storage tanks (HSTs) are key devices for maintaining reliable and cost-effective IPHDS operations via power peak shaving while supporting the charging demands of hydrogen vehicles (HVs). This study proposes an optimization framework that ensures profitable and robust operations of on-site HRSs under uncertainties in IPHDSs. Compared with conventional methods that manage IPHDS operation using single HST (S-HST)-based HRSs through only power peak shaving, the proposed method performs dual-peak shaving of power and hydrogen through substations and ELs in multiple HST (M-HST)-based HRSs, respectively. The proposed optimization framework is implemented using chance-constrained optimization (CCO) to address uncertainties in PV generation outputs and HV charging demands in IPHDSs. Furthermore, the proposed CCO framework includes constraints that adjust the predicted HV charging demand, thereby satisfying the actual HV charging demand for each predetermined scheduling period. Numerical examples conducted on IPHDSs (IEEE 33-node and 69-node power distribution systems with three and five on-site HRSs) show that, compared to a method with S-HST and only power peak shaving, the proposed CCO method with M-HST based on dual-peak shaving of power and hydrogen increases the total profit by 5.88% and 8.19% on average, respectively, under varying HV charging demand adjustment period and chance-constraint violation probability.

AB Four types of reactivity indices were employed to construct quantitative structure-activity relationships for the assessment of toxicity of organic chemical mixtures. Results of analysis indicated that the maximum positive charge of the hydrogen atom and the inverse of the apolar surface area are the most important descriptors for the toxicity of mixture of benzene and its derivatives to Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity of mixture of aromatic compounds to green alga Scenedesmus obliquus is mainly affected by the electron flow and electrostatic interactions. The electron-acceptance chemical potential and the maximum positive charge of the hydrogen atom are found to be the most important descriptors for the joint toxicity of aromatic compounds.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID ABOVE-THRESHOLD DISSOCIATION; SCHRODINGER-EQUATION; DYNAMICS; H-2(+);
   BOND
AB Isotope effects on the ionization of hydrogen molecular ions in strong laser fields are studied by numerically simulating the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Though the isotopes of hydrogen molecular ions have identical Born-Oppenheimer potential curves, the distinct ionization scenarios are observed for single-photon, multiphoton, and tunneling ionization. For multiphoton and tunneling ionization, the ionization rate of H-2(+) is larger than that of D-2(+) and T-2(+). The ratio of the intensity-dependent tunneling ionization probabilities of H-2(+) (D-2(+)) and T-2(+) can be qualitatively explained by the adiabatic tunneling theories if a few-femtosecond ultrashort pulse is used. For tens of femtosecond laser pulses, the nuclear movement is unavoidable and the time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulation is necessary in order to calculate the ionization probability accurately. For single-photon ionization, the electron-nuclei joint energy spectra are distinct though the total ionization probabilities are similar. The elastic constant of potential curves can be retrieved by comparing the single-photon-induced electron-nuclei joint energy spectra of different isotopic molecular ions, which offers a potential technique to image molecules.

AB Oxidation of lignin to value-added aromatics through selective C-C bond cleavage via metal-free and mild strategies is promising but challenging. It was discovered that the cations of ionic liquids (ILs) could effectively catalyze this kind of strong bond cleavage by forming multiple weak hydrogen bonds, enabling the reaction conducted in air at temperature lower than 373 K without metal-containing catalysts. The cation [CPMim](+)(1-propylronitrile-3-methylimidazolium) afforded the highest efficiency in C-C bond cleavage, in which high yields (>90 %) of oxidative products were achieved. [CPMim](+)could form three ipsilateral hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of C=O and ether bonds at both sides of the C-C bond. The weak bonds joint effects could promote adjacent C-H bond cleave to form free radicals and thereby catalyze the fragmentation of the strong C-C. This work opens up an eco-friendly and energy-efficient route for direct valorization of lignin by enhancing IL properties via tuning the cation.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue that hinders the reliability of hydrogenation reactors. Hence, it is of great significance to investigate the effect of hydrogen on fracture toughness of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel and weld. In this work, the fracture behavior of 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel and welds was studied by three-point bending tests under hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged conditions. The immersion charging method was employed to pre-charge hydrogen inside specimen and the fracture toughness of these joints was evaluated quantitatively. The microstructure and grain size of the specimens were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by metallurgical microscopy to investigate the HE mechanisms. It was found that fracture toughness for both the base metal (BM) and the weld zone (WZ) significantly decreased under hydrogen-charged conditions due to the coexistence of the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) mechanisms. Moreover, the formation and growth of primary voids were observed in the BM, leading to a superior fracture toughness. In addition, the BM compared to the WZ shows superior resistance to HE because the finer grain size in the BM leads to a larger grain boundary area, thus distributing more of the diffusive hydrogen trapped in the grain boundary and reducing the hydrogen content.

AB This research paper numerically studies how hydrocarbon additives affect hydrogen combustion in the process of complex fuel burning on the example of the combustible foam representing the heptane-in-water emulsion foamed with a hydrogen-oxygen mixture. It is demonstrated that the two-phase hydrodynamic model with an account of foam structure and chemical kinetics reproduces quite accurately, at least at the qualitative level, the experimentally observed features of foamed emulsion combustion. Due to this, it is concluded that a proposed model can be fruitfully used for the interpretation of the combustion features observed in such a complex combined fuel. Based on the obtained numerical data, it is found that there are two main possibilities related to the hydrogen-hydrocarbon chemistry interactions. In the case of near-stoichiometric, hydrocarbons act mainly as an inhibitor of hydrogen combustion; however, for lean hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, flame propagation is determined by the joint hydrocarbon and hydrogen oxidation kinetics. Herewith, the hydrocarbon burns together with the hydrogen inside the flame front in the case of slow combustion, while in the case of high-speed combustion, hydrogen oxidation kinetics becomes predominant, and hydrocarbons evaporate and burn behind the flame front, causing a lesser effect on the flame dynamics.

AB Three possible ways are known to transport hydrogen by pipeline: (i) blending hydrogen into the existing natural gas pipeline system; (ii) using the natural gas transporting pipeline system to transport (pure) hydrogen, typically after retrofitting or repurposing; and (iii) building a new pipeline system to transport (pure) hydrogen. In all three cases, the used welded or non-welded pipes must be joined with girth welds. Therefore, these low-alloy steel pipelines contain a large number of girth welds, which play a key role in the integrity of the whole pipelines. The own integrity of the girth welds can be interpreted as depending on a number of factors. The factors affecting integrity were systematized and the effect of hydrogen for the natural gas transporting pipelines was interpreted. The influence of material quality was illustrated using the example of two conventional pipeline material (X42 and X52, as older materials) and a high-strength pipeline material (X100, as newer material) that is becoming more widely used. Furthermore, various test results for welded joints were also presented.

AB Hydrogen bonding is one of the exciting and interesting research themes because it plays important roles in biomolecules, plant cells, and so on. Here we report hydrogen-bonded complexes among the photodecomposition products of thiazole, being studied by a joint use of infrared (IR) spectroscopy and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Three types of hydrogen-bonded complexes of ethynethiol (HS-C  CH) and hydrogen cyanide (HC  N), which are photodecomposed by two cleavages of the NC-SC and CN-CC single bonds of thiazole in argon matrices, have been identified by comparison of the observed IR spectra with the corresponding calculated spectral patterns. In addition, another complex with weak interaction between S atom and HCF  N, which are photoproduced by cleavages of the three single bonds of thiazole, is detected by comparison with the wavenumbers previously reported in literature. The reaction mechanisms to form these complexes are discussed based on the analysis of IR spectra and the DFT calculations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is one of the most promising high-capacity hydrogen storage materials. However, limited progress has been made in storing hydrogen in Mg under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the dehydrogenated MgH2 is fully hydrogenated below 100 degrees C with the presence of N-containing Nb2O5 (N-Nb2O5). MgH2 composites doped with N-Nb2O5 (10 wt%) releases hydrogen from 170 degrees C, which is lowered by 130 degrees C compared with pristine MgH2, while still having 6.3 wt% hydrogen capacity available. Most importantly, full hydrogenation can be achieved by the dehydrogenated N-Nb2O5-containing sample at temperature as low as 70 degrees C under 50 atm of hydrogen, which is superior to other known catalyst-doped MgH2 systems. The in-situ formed NbN0.9O0.1 plays the critical catalyst role due to the joint action of N and Nb as elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This finding remarkably facilitates the future design and exploration of much higher-performance catalysts for room-temperature hydrogen storage in metal hydrides.

AB The adoption of electrolytic hydrogen-based steelmaking technology has recently garnered increasing attention as a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions within the framework of industrial decarbonization. Nonetheless, the high costs associated with hydrogen production via electrolysis stand as a key challenge to the widespread deployment of this technology, necessitating strategies to improve its economic feasibility. To that end, this paper introduces an optimal scheduling model for a hydrogen-based steelmaking facility equipped with an on-site electrolysis-based hydrogen production and storage system. The model mainly aims to: 1) exploit lower electricity prices to minimize the overall operating costs of the entire system, 2) contribute to the capacity auction market as a demand response resource for the joint benefit of the steel sector and electricity grid operator, and 3) ensure the safe operation of the hydrogen production system via keeping the hydrogen content in oxygen within safety permissible limits. As such, the economic feasibility of the hydrogen-based steelmaking technology would be further improved due to energy cost savings and extra financial settlements from capacity auction participation. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated using numerical case studies, demonstrating its potential to support the transition to low-carbon steel production.

AB With the widespread utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen safety issues, especially hydrogen jet fires, should be much paid attention to, since the latter present high temperature and radiation in confined space. Hydrogen jet fire experiments were conducted with various release rates and vent sizes in a confined space with ceiling vent to investigate the hydrogen jet flame height, oxygen concentration, and self-extinguishing time. The results show that, the large vent sizes with low hydrogen release rates result in well-ventilated hydrogen jet fires. As the vent size decreases or the hydrogen release rate increases, the hydrogen jet flame evolves from a wellventilated one to one having self-extinguishing behavior with under-ventilation. The combustion process can be divided into four stages: the growth stage, the quasi-steady stage, the stretch stage and the self-extinguishing stage. The flame height increases with the hydrogen release rate at the quasi-steady stage, and the vent size has almost no effect. However, in the case of under-ventilation, the flame height at the stretch stage is determined by the joint actions of vent size and hydrogen release rate, and the flame height is positively connected with the size of the ceiling vent. The oxygen concentration and self-extinguishing time decrease dramatically as the vent size and hydrogen release rate increase. The parameter VA1/3Q is proposed to reflect the coupling effects of hydrogen release rate and vent size, and the correlations of oxygen concentration and self-extinguishing time are determined with Q VA1/3.

AB Hydrogen energy has attracted a lot of interest from researchers as a sustainable and renewable energy source, but there are some technical challenges related to its storage. Hydride materials demonstrate the ability to store hydrogen adequately and safely. In the current study, we have investigated the structural and optoelectronic properties of the XCuH 3 (where X = Li, Na and K) perovskite-type hydride using LDA and GGA formalisms for hydrogen storage application. Electronic properties such as band structure, density of states reveal the metallic character of the studied XCuH 3 hydrides. Various optical parameters such as the complex dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, optical conductivity, energy loss function, and joint density of states have been computed and compared. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity for LiCuH 3 , NaCuH 3 and KCuH 3 are found to be 4.11, 3.37 and 2.86 wt%, respectively. The computed values of the gravimetric ratio manifest that XCuH 3 hydrides are potential candidates for hydrogen storage applications. These calculations are made for the first time for XCuH 3 hydrides and will be inspirational in the future for comparison and for hydrogen storage purposes.

AB In this study, a novel MoO3@MoS2/TiO2 photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency was prepared via a hydrothermal followed by quenching method. The prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis Spectrophotometers, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution was also investigated. The results show that MoS2-340 degrees C/TiO2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency (4669 mu molg(-1)h(-)(1)), which is 5.8 times higher than that of unquenched MoS2/TiO2 under the same conditions. MoO3 on the surface and edges of large layered MoS2 creates more traps adjacent to the joint. More photogenerated electrons can be enriched during the photocatalytic reaction, which achieve the purpose of exposing more active sites.

AB Thermomechanical Controlled Processing (TMCP), the initial microstructure and mechanical properties of rolled products made of high-strength steels, have a significant influence on the properties and reliability of welded structures for low temperature and cryogenic service. This paper systematizes advanced research trends in the field of metallurgy and weldability of high-strength cold-resistant and cryogenic steels. The classification and properties of high-strength steels are given and TMCP diagrams and phase transformations are considered. Modern methods of improving the viscoplasticity of rolled steel and welded joints are analyzed. The problems of the weldability of high-strength steels are reduction of impact toughness at low temperatures, hydrogen embrittlement, anisotropy, and softening of welded joints in the heat-affected zone. The authors propose a systemic concept and methods for improving the metallurgy and weldability of high-strength steels for low temperature and cryogenic service.

AB The steel grade 20MnMoNi5-5 (according to German DIN standard or 16MND5 according to French AFNOR standard) is widely applied in (weld) fabrication of reactor pressure vessel components. Thus, a wide range of welding technologies (like submerged arc welding (SAW) or tungsten inert gas (TIG)) is used resulting in different heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures. During weld fabrication, the weld joints may take up hydrogen. Especially, the HAZ shows an increased susceptibility for a degradation of the mechanical properties in presence of hydrogen. In addition, the hydrogen-assisted degradation of mechanical properties is influenced by three main local factors: hydrogen concentration, microstructure, and load condition. Hence, the base material (BM) and two different simulated non-tempered as-quenched HAZ microstructures were examined using hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged tensile specimens. The results indicate that the effect of hydrogen on the degradation is significantly increased in case of the HAZ compared to the BM. In addition, hydrogen has remarkable effect in terms of reduction of ductility. It was ascertained that the degradation of the mechanical properties increases in the order of BM, bainitic HAZ, and the martensitic HAZ. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation showed a distinct change of the fracture topography depended on the microstructure with increasing hydrogen concentration in case of the as-quenched HAZ microstructures.

AB Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are widespread rheumatic diseases characterized by persistent inflammation and joint destruction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gas with important physiologic functions in the brain, vasculature and other organs. Recent studies have found H2S to be a mediator in inflammatory joint diseases.
   Objective: This review summarizes the recent literature in this area highlighting relevant developments.
   Conclusions: Several authors have found that H2S exhibited anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic and/or anti-oxidant effects in rodent models of acute arthritis and in in vitro models using human synoviocytes and articular chondrocytes from RA and OA tissues. The earliest studies used fast-dissolving salts, such as NaSH, but GYY4137, which produces H2S more physiologically, shortly appeared. More recently still, new H2S-forming compounds that target mitochondria have been synthesized. These compounds open exciting opportunities for investigating the role of H2S in cell bioenergetics, typically altered in arthritides. Positive results have also been obtained when H2S is administered as a sulphurous water bath, an option meriting further study. These findings suggest that exogenous supplementation of H2S may provide a viable therapeutic option for these diseases, particularly in OA.

AB In this investigation, comparative study of tensile and impact properties of multi-pass SMAW Armox 500T steel joints fabricated by austenitic stainless steel (ASS) and low hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF) consumables vis-a-vis base metal was carried out. The tensile tests were conducted on computer controlled Walter + Bai Ag UTM at a nominal strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1). Subsequently, charpy impact tests were carried out on an instrumented Zwick-Roell test setup to obtain load vs. displacement and maximum energy absorbed vs. displacement of the specimen. It was observed that, the joint efficiency of weldment processed by LHF consumable was 41.7% and weldment processed by ASS was 30.6% of its base metal indicating the influence of electrode consumable on tensile properties of the joints. On the contrary, impact toughness of weldment processed by ASS was 20% more and weldment processed by LHF was 12% less than that of base metal. Microstructural studies also revealed that, ASS can be considered as a candidate welding consumable for good strain hardening and toughness of the welding joint in impact applications. However, LHF steel consumable is recommended for welding joints that requires higher joint efficiency under tensile loading conditions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrogen storage at high pressure is currently attained by the use of different materials, such as elastomers in sealing joints, thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers in high-pressure containers, and metallic tube connections. Hydrogen containers type IV use a thermoplastic polymer for hydrogen tightness and composite materials for mechanical resistance, usually made with thermosetting resins and carbon or glass fibre. International standards impose a wide range of operative temperatures for such containers, from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C.
   Once saturated with hydrogen at high pressure, a fast depressurisation process can create stress in the polymeric materials, causing its degradation by the formation of cavities. In a previous work, we were able to make a generalization of cavitation risk by the use of non-dimensional parameters, based on a simplified mechanical failure model. We observed that for the model, material's hydrogen diffusivity and yield strength are of up- most importance. In present work, we analyse the effect of temperature on these two properties, as they have an inverse evolution with temperature. Results confirm the pertinence of considering temperature in the whole application range of technology under analyse. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Body fluid is normally the only lubricant after joint replacement surgery, but wear problems have occurred because body fluid has poor lubrication ability. However, traditional lubricant would be diluted by body fluids and then absorbed by the human body. Therefore, an injectable gel with the ability to slow-release lubricant was designed to replace the joint capsule. The proposed gel, poly(ethylene glycol)/chitosan/sodium glycerophosphate (PEG/CS/GP) composite gel was then tested. The tribology results showed that the PEG/CS/GP gel had excellent slow-release properties, especially under pressure, and the PEG played an important role in improving the gel's rheological and mechanical properties. Moreover, this study revealed that the release solution had a good lubrication effect because the PEG and GP could crosslink via the hydrogen bond effect.

AB Resin-based carbon fibre reinforced composite (CFRP) with excellent properties has been widely applied in aerospace industry. In this study, polyether ether ketone enforced composite (PEEK-CFRP) and Ti-6V-4V titanium alloy had been joined by laser welding process. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) process was conducted on the surface of titanium alloy to improve the joint property. Fractures and mechanical properties of joints were analysed. Interfacial microstructures of the joints had been investigated, and the formation mechanism of joint had been figured out. The results showed that after MAO treatment, the joint strength had been greatly improved and the shear strength reached to 42.3 MPa compared with pretreated sample. The wettability of CFRP on titanium alloy was rising with the contact angle of 68.8 degrees. Fracture showed that cohesive failure contributed to the main fracture mode. As joints were formed by both mechanical bonding and chemical bonding, 'anchor-shaped' structures were found in the joint to enhance the mechanical bonding effects due to the flowing of the melted resin. (-OH) bonds were identified at the surface of MAO-treated titanium alloy that provided conditions for hydrogen bond interaction. TiO2, TiO and Ti-V-C phase were found at interface, whereas Ti-F and Ti-O-F bonds were generated during the welding process, which made great contribution to the chemical bonds between titanium alloy and CFRP.

AB The review summarizes and critically analyzes the results of exploratory and basic studies carried out mainly in the last 10 years concerning the mechanism and role of hydrogen transfer reactions in hydrocarbon conversion processes. A discussion addresses the established views on the regularities of these reactions (mainly involving hydrogen - hydrogen, carbon - carbon and carbon - hydrogen bonds) in various systems containing cations of d-, p - and s-elements. The features of intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions involved in the zeolite-catalyzed cracking of hydrocarbons are considered. Data on the development of compositions and investigation of properties of modern zeolite-based catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking are discussed. The attention is focused on the role of intermolecular hydrogen transfer in this process, especially in the transformations of heteroatomic compounds. Regarding zeolite compositions, the main attention is paid to the influence of the acid site distribution on the zeolite surface on the hydrogen transfer reactions and the role of extra-framework aluminium species and added modifier cations in these processes. The results of studies of hydrogen transfer by model calculations and by drawing analogies are presented. It is demonstrated that intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions must be taken into account while addressing problems of improving the cracking catalysts and creating catalytic compositions for joint processing of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen compounds together with hydrocarbons in the catalytic cracking. The bibliography includes 249 references.

AB The evaluation of the mechanical properties of post-fire high-strength steel welds, particularly for secondary applications in medium- and large-scale infrastructure, is of critical importance in engineering. This study investigates Q690 high-strength steel welds subjected to heat treatment at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for 20 minutes, followed by air cooling. Electrochemical hydrogen charging, uniaxial tensile testing, and fracture morphology analysis were employed to examine the mechanical properties of these welded components after fire exposure. The effects of hydrogen embrittlement on the mechanical properties and fracture modes of Q690 welds were analyzed, and a hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity index for the welding joints was proposed. The results of the study show that the heat treatment temperature has a significant effect on the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of welded structural components. Higher heat treatment temperatures and longer hydrogen charging times lead to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the material, which is characterised by a flatter and smoother macroscopic fracture surface, while the microscopic fracture pattern is characterised by micro-voids. Hydrogen-induced deformation leads to the accumulation of structural defects, such as micro-inhomogeneities and micro-voids, due to increased hydrogen concentrations. Consequently, the material's resistance to brittle failure is diminished.

AB Thick high-strength steel plates are increasingly being used for ship structures. Moreover, hydrogen enters the process of manufacturing and service, and large residual tensile stress occurs near the weld. Such stress can facilitate the diffusion and accumulation of hydrogen in the material, leading to hydrogen embrittlement fracture of the shell. Therefore, residual-stress-induced diffusion and accumulation of hydrogen in the stress concentration region of thick butt-welded high-strength steel plate structures need to be studied. In this study, manual metal arc welding was realized by numerical simulation of residual stress in a thick butt-welded high-strength steel plate model using the thermoelastic-plastic theory and a double ellipsoidal heat source model. To analyze residual stress, a set of numerical simulation methods was obtained through comparative analysis of the test results of relevant literature. Residual and hydrostatic stress distributions were determined based on these methods. Then, hydrogen diffusion parameters in each region of the model were obtained through experimental tests. Finally, the results of the residual stress field were used as the predefined field of hydrogen diffusion to conduct a numerical simulation analysis. The distribution of hydrogen diffusion under the influence of residual stress was obtained based on the theory of stress-induced hydrogen diffusion. The weak area of the welding joint was found to be near the weld toe, which exhibited high hydrostatic stress and hydrogen concentration. Further, the maximum hydrogen concentration value of the vertical weld path was approximately 6.1 ppm, and the maximum value of the path parallel to the weld centerline and 31 mm away from the weld centerline was approximately 6.22 ppm. Finally, the hydrostatic tensile stress in the vertical weld path was maximized (similar to 345 MPa), degrading the material properties and causing hydrogen-related cracking. Hence, a reliable method for the analysis of hydrogen diffusion according to residual stress in thick high-strength steel plates was obtained. This work could provide a research basis for controlling and eliminating the adverse effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of ship structures and ensuring the safe service of marine equipment.

AB SiC is highly suitable for the manufacturing of ceramic heat exchangers due to its exceptional strength and thermal conductivity. However, its brittleness makes it difficult to machine directly. Brazing simple SiC components to form stable joints presents a more reliable and efficient method for constructing these complex heat exchanger structures. Since these exchangers operate in high-temperature acidic environments, the reliability of the joints faces inevitable challenges due to the high brittleness and the risk of galvanic corrosion of the heterogeneous interface between SiC and the metallic filler. Ni-based fillers are commonly used for SiC brazing, as the active element Ni reacts with SiC to form Ni-Si phases that establish a bond. However, these Ni-Si phases are generally brittle and susceptible to corrosion. To address this issue, Au was introduced into the brazing joint by designing an AuNi filler. Au forms stable covalent bonds with Si, reducing the formation of brittle Ni-Si phases. The Fermi level of the Ni-Si phase is the highest in both joints, thus indicating a greater susceptibility to corrosion. The Cr-rich phase in the BNi-2 joint promotes severe hydrogen evolution corrosion, whereas the AuNi joint demonstrates significantly greater resistance to this process. Therefore, the AuNi joints achieve higher shear strength (62 MPa) than BNi-2 joints (30.8 MPa) and retain 86.66 % strength after HCl corrosion, compared to BNi-2's 38.31 %. The use of the AuNi filler enhances joint performance and facilitates the production of corrosion-resistant SiC heat exchangers.

AB Wood Polymer Composites (WPCs) have become widely acceptable for use in different products, including furniture. This range of applications could be increased by improvement in effective bonding and jointing techniques. However adhesion between WPC components is problematic because of their low surface energy and the hydrophobic nature of the polyolefin matrices which are commonly used. Surface activation pretreatments using hydrogen peroxide solutions have been investigated, and shown an improvement in lap-joint shear when bonding using epoxy adhesives. The effect on surface energy, roughness and chemical composition was studied. The improvement in adhesion appeared to be governed by the pH of the treatment solution, with clear differences being identified between treatments in acidic and alkaline media.
   The best results were achieved with a mild alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment at a pH of 7.5 (37% improvement); however a mild acidic hydrogen peroxide treatment also showed a suitable level of adhesion improvement (29%, pH 6). In the alkaline medium it was found that the hydroperoxy anion was efficient in altering both the lignin and the hemicellulose component of the wood flour. It was necessary to limit the extent of wood particle degradation by the hydroperoxy anion, explaining the poor adhesion for treatments with pH 9 peroxide solution. This study indicates that mild (pH 7.5) alkaline treatment solution could be employed. In the acidic medium, the free radical based reaction processes dominated, and were likely to have altered the polypropylene matrix of the WPC material.

AB Zircaloy-4 to Zircaloy-4 (Zr-4) similar butt joints were prepared using Electron Beam Welding (EBW) technique under different weld conditions such as with beam oscillation, without beam oscillation and at different welding speeds. Three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of porosity in weld joints was carried out using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) technique. Quantification of porosity such as the average size, number and shape of the pores were evaluated and compared among weld joints produced under different conditions. XCT results show that the porosity of the welds increased substantially with the increase in the weld speed. More interestingly, the results also show that there is a significant decrease in porosity of the joint produced with beam oscillation condition. An increase in weld speed from 700 mm/min to 1000 mm/min resulted in a significant increase in pore density (from 16 to 313 per mm3) and it was observed that the average size of the macro pores increased from 96.4 mu m to 121.5 mu m. The joints prepared with beam oscillation produced least number of pores with minimum percentage of macro pores and maximum percentage of spherical pores in it. Raman spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of hydrogen gas in pores of all the weld joints.

AB The service life of artificial joints has gradually failed to meet the needs of patients. Herein, the synergistic lubrication and antioxidant efficacies of graphene oxide (GO) and fullerenol (Fol) as biological lubricant additives for artificial joints were investigated. The lubrication mechanisms of biological lubricant containing GO and Fol at the friction interface of artificial joints were then revealed. Tribological tests showed that the average friction coefficients of Al2O3-Ti6Al4V pairs and Ti6Al4V-UHMWPE pairs for artificial joints could be reduced by 30% and 22%, respectively, when GO and Fol were used as biological lubricant additives simultaneously. The lubrication mechanism showed that some incommensurate sliding contact surfaces could be formed between the GO nanosheets and spherical Fol at the interface, which reduced the interaction forces of friction pairs. The maximum scavenging rates of center dot OH and DPPH free radicals by the biological lubricant containing GO and Fol were 35% and 45%, respectively, showing a good antioxidant efficacy of the biological lubricant. This can be attributed to the GO and Fol scavenging free radicals through electron transfer and hydrogen transfer. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development and application of carbon nanomaterials as biological lubricant additives for artificial joints in the future.

SO KERNTECHNIK
LA English
DT Article
AB The THAI (THAI = Thermal hydraulics, Hydrogen, Aerosols, Iodine) experimental programme aims to address open questions concerning the behavior of hydrogen, iodine and aerosols in the containment of water cooled reactors. Since its construction in 2000, THAI programme is being performed in the frame of various national projects (sponsored by German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, BMWi) and two international joint projects (under auspices of OECD/NEA). THAI experimental data have been widely used for the validation and further development of Lumped Parameter (LP) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes with 3D capabilities. Selected examples of code benchmark exercises performed based on the THAI data include; hydrogen distribution experiment (ISP-47 and OECD/NEA THAI code benchmark), hydrogen combustion behaviour (ISP-49), hydrogen mitigation by PARs (OECD/NEA THAI-2 code benchmark), iodine/surface interactions, iodine mass transfer, and iodine transport and multi-compartment behaviour (EU-SARNET and EU-SARNET2), thermal-hydraulic tests (German CFD-network). In the present paper, a brief overview on the THAI experiments and their role in the containment safety assessment is discussed.

AB The dual laser beam bilateral synchronous welding (DLBSW) for T-joint is limited to develop for the porosity defect in joint. In order to investigate the effect of porosity in T-joint, the DLBSW experiment of 2219 Aluminum Alloy T-joint is carried out. While, the distribution of porosity is scanned by X-ray non-destructive testing (NDT) and the size of porosity is measured by particle size analysis software Nano measurer 1.2. The morphology of pore in fracture and the elemental concentration around the pore are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy spectrometer (EDS). Furthermore, the analysis results of porosity distribution show that the optimal parameter is 3700 W of laser power and 2.5 m/min of welding rate, under which the number of porosities reaches the minimum. The main factor, caused the fracture of weld seam, is the concentrated porosities in T-joint. In addition, technical porosity is mainly found in the center of the weld seam or at the bottom of the weld seam, and it can be eliminated by improving welding parameters. Metallurgical porosity mainly exists at the edge and the top of the weld seam, including hydrogen porosity and metal vapor porosity which formed by the burning of metal elements.

AB This paper summarises the results from 66 vented hydrogen deflagration experiments performed in 20-foot shipping containers: 42 tests with initially homogeneous and quiescent mixtures, and 24 tests with inhomogeneous mixtures. Other parameters investigated include hydrogen concentration, vent area, type of venting device, ignition position, and the level and type of congestion inside the container. The results confirm that internal congestion can increase the maximum reduced explosion pressure in vented deflagrations significantly, compared to vented deflagrations in empty enclosures. As such, it is important to incorporate the effect of congestion in the theoretical and/or empirical correlations recommended in standards and guidelines for explosion protection. The work reported here is a deliverable from work package 2 (WP2) in the project "Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations" (HySEA).

AB This paper describes an experimental programme on vented hydrogen deflagrations, which formed part of the Hyindoor project, carried out for the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of analytical models used to calculate overpressures following a low concentration hydrogen deflagration. Other aspects of safety were also investigated, such as lateral flame length resulting from explosion venting. The experimental programme included the investigation of vented hydrogen deflagrations from a 31 m(3) enclosure with a maximum internal overpressure target of 10 kPa (100 mbar). The explosion relief was provided by lightly covered openings in the roof or sidewalls. Uniform and stratified initial hydrogen distributions were included in the test matrix and the location of the ignition source was also varied. The maximum hydrogen concentration used within the enclosure was 14% v/v. The hydrogen concentration profile within the enclosure was measured, as were the internal and external pressures. Infrared video images were obtained of the gases vented during the deflagrations. Findings show that the analytical models were generally conservative for overpressure predictions. Flame lengths were found to be far less than suggested by some guidance. Along with the findings, the methodology, test conditions and corresponding results are presented.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) gas has recently become a crucial energy source and an imperative energy vector, emerging as a powerful next-generation solution for fuel cells and biomedical, transportation, and household applications. With increasing interest in H-2, safety concerns regarding personal injuries from its flammability and explosion at high concentrations (>4%) have inspired the development of wearable pre-emptive gas monitoring platforms that can operate on curved and jointed parts of the human body. In this study, a yarn-type hydrogen gas sensing platform (HGSP) was developed by biscrolling of palladium oxide nanoparticles (PdO NPs) and spinnable carbon nanotube (CNT) buckypapers. Because of the high loading of H-2-active PdO NPs (up to 97.7 wt %), when exposed to a flammable H-2 concentration (4 vol %), the biscrolled HGSP yarn exhibits a short response time of 2 s, with a high sensitivity of 1198% (defined as Delta G/G(0) x 100%). Interestingly, during the reduction of PdO to Pd by H-2 gas, the HGSP yarn experienced a decrease in diameter and corresponding volume contraction. These excellent sensing performances suggest that the fabricated HGSP yarn could be applied to a wearable gas monitoring platform for real-time detection of H-2 gas leakage even over the bends of joints.

The microstructure, room temperature and high temperature (1173 K) tensile strength of dissimilar weld joints were analyzed through optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electronic universal tensile testing machine. The microstructure of HAZ in 15CrMo steel of Cr25Ni35NbM/15CrMo dissimilar weld joint transformed from ferrite-pearlite into ferrite-martensite. A large volume fraction of alpha phase was found to have precipitated in the HAZ of SUS321 austenitic stainless steel for Cr25Ni35NbM/SUS321 dissimilar weld joint. At room temperature, the tensile strength and yield strength of these two type dissimilar weld joints is less than Cr25Ni35NbM alloy similar weld joint. The high temperature tensile strength of these two type dissimilar weld joints is less than Cr25Ni35NbM alloy similar weld joint. Both at room and high temperature, the fracture locations of two types dissimilar weld joints are the HAZ of the base metal 15CrMo and SUS321 stainless steel, respectively. It indicates that the weak part of the Cr25Ni35NbM alloy dissimilar weld joints is the low-performance base metals 15CrMo and SUS321 stainless steel.

AB The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviors at slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) test of AISI301L stainless steel laser MIG welded joints in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at 20 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C were investigated. The results showed that the weld metal composed of as-cast with delta-Fe and austenite. The base metal (BM) and heat affected zone (HAZ) contained strain-induced M phase. The stress and strain decreased with the increasing temperature. The SCC cracks are initiated by anodic dissolution at 20 degrees C. Besides the anodic dissolution mechanism, hydrogen-induced SCC mechanism had appeared in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C.

AB This paper investigates physically crosslinked organo-hydrogels for total hip replacement surgery. Current materials in artificial joints have limitations in mechanical performance and biocompatibility. To overcome these issues, a new approach based on hydrogen bonds between polyvinyl alcohol, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), and glycerin is proposed to develop bioactive organo-hydrogels with improved mechanical properties and biocompatibility. This study analyzes local pathological characteristics, systemic toxicity, and mechanical properties of the gels. The results show that the gels possess excellent biocompatibility and mechanical strength, suggesting their potential as an alternative material for total hip replacement surgery. These findings contribute to improving patient outcomes in joint replacement procedures.

AB The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Global Technical Regulation (GTR) Number 13 (Global Technical Regulation on Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles) is the defining document regulating safety requirements in hydrogen vehicles, and in particular, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). GTR Number 13 has been formally adopted and will serve as the basis for the national regulatory standards for FCEV safety in North America (led by the United States), Japan, Korea, and the European Union. The GTR defines safety requirements for these vehicles, including specifications on the allowable hydrogen levels in vehicle enclosures during in-use and post-crash conditions and on the allowable hydrogen emissions levels in vehicle exhaust during certain modes of normal operation. However, in order to be incorporated into national regulations, that is, to be legally binding, methods to verify compliance with the specific requirements must exist. In a collaborative program, the Sensor Laboratories at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States and the Joint Research Centre, Institute for Energy and Transport in the Netherlands have been evaluating and developing analytical methods that can be used to verify compliance with the hydrogen release requirements as specified in the GTR.

AB Hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) will proliferate in the near future as they are prerequisites for the fast developing hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). The HFSs can utilize cheap renewable energy from, e.g., wind turbines (WTs), to generate and store hydrogen on site locally. Conventional studies usually ignore the independence of the WT and HFSs and perform joint operation optimization to them. This article, however, proposes a cooperative operation model for the WT and HFSs considering individual benefit. Nash bargaining theory is employed to deal with the energy trading and benefit sharing problems during the cooperation. In particular, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to characterize the risk-preference degree of HFSs against the uncertainties of electricity price. Moreover, an improved benders decomposition (BD) algorithm is proposed to solve the energy trading problem in a distributed manner for privacy concern; while an analytical method is developed to solve the payment bargaining problem. Numerical experiments based on two case studies indicate that the cooperation can greatly reduce the hydrogen production cost for HFSs. In addition, the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm in the case studies.

AB The invited talk given at MH2014 in Salford ranged over many issues associated with hydrogen isotope separation, fusion machines and the hydrogen/metal systems found in the Joint European Torus (JET) machine located near Oxford. As this sort of talk does not lend itself well to a paper below I have attempted to highlight some of the more pertinent information. After a description of the Active Gas Handling System (AGHS) a brief summary of isotope separation systems is described followed by descriptions of three major projects currently being undertaken by the Tritium Engineering and Science Group (TESG), the upgrade to the Analytical Systems (AN-GC) at the AGH, the construction of a Water Detritiation System (WDS) and a Material Detritiation Facility (MDF). Finally, a review of some of the challenges facing fusion with respect to metal/hydrogen systems is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of hydrogen enrichment on flame and flow dynamics of a swirl-stabilised partially premixed methane-air flame are studied using large eddy simulation. The sub-grid reaction rate is modelled using unstrained premixed flamelets and a presumed joint probability density function approach. Two cases undergoing thermoacoustic oscillations at ambient conditions are studied. The addition of hydrogen modifies both thermoacoustic and fluid dynamical characteristics. The amplitude of the fundamental thermoacoustic mode increases with the addition of 20% hydrogen by volume. A second pressure mode associated with the chamber mode is also excited with the hydrogen addition. Intermittent single, double and triple helical instabilities are observed in the pure methane case, but are suppressed substantially with hydrogen addition. The results are analysed in detail to shed light on these observations. The feedback loop responsible for the thermoacoustic instability is driven by mixture fraction perturbations resulting from the unequal impedances of the fuel and air channels. It is shown that hydrogen addition increases the flame's sensitivity to these perturbations, resulting in an increase in amplitude. This higher amplitude thermoacoustic oscillation, along with a higher local heat release rate in the presence of hydrogen, is shown to considerably modify the flow structures, leading to a suppression of the helical instabilities.

AB In the past decades, complex hydrides and complex hydrides-based materials have been thoroughly investigated as materials for energy storage, owing to their very high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities and interesting cation and hydrogen diffusion properties. Concerning hydrogen storage, the main limitations of this class of materials are the high working temperatures and pressures, the low hydrogen absorption and desorption rates and the poor cyclability. In the past years, research in this field has been focused on understanding the hydrogen release and uptake mechanism of the pristine and catalyzed materials and on the characterization of the thermodynamic aspects, in order to rationally choose the composition and the stoichiometry of the systems in terms of hydrogen active phases and catalysts/destabilizing agents. Moreover, new materials have been discovered and characterized in an attempt to find systems with properties suitable for practical on-board and stationary applications. A significant part of this rich and productive activity has been performed by the research groups led by the Experts of the International Energy Agreement Task 32, often in collaborative research projects. The most recent findings of these joint activities and other noteworthy recent results in the field are reported in this paper. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Corrosion resistance is a crucial property to achieve successful superconducting joints of Y0.5Gd0.5Ba2Cu3O7-z (YGdBCO) coated conductors (CCs). Cu and Ag metallic layers need to be fully removed from the area of conductor to be joint to allow for a superconducting path across the joint. Therefore, when using a wet etching process to remove the metallic layers, the joint performance can be significantly influenced by the etching conditions. The effects of chemical etching with ammonia water and hydrogen peroxide mixture on crystal structure, surface microstructure and critical current (I-c) of YGdBCO CCs were systematically investigated. We found the set of etching parameters that does not affect conductor performance, leaving the I-c of the YGdBCO conductor unchanged upon etching. However, when the etching conditions are not optimal, decrease in I-c was found and the underlying reasons driving the degradation were investigated. Raman spectroscopy and XRD analysis indicated that the reduced I-c is mainly due to oxygen deficiency in the YGdBCO crystal lattice.

AB The waste gasification has emerged as a promising method for waste treatment and energy generation, but high operational costs hinder its development. Currently, waste gasification plants are aggregated with renewable energy sources into virtual power plant to participate in the combined electricity-hydrogen market, thereby increasing its profitability. Even so, the carbon reduction potential of this technology is often overlooked, limiting the development of waste resource treatment. Based on this, this paper introduces a tradable green certificate market and a carbon emissions trading market to convert carbon reduction potential into economic benefits. Further, inter-market coupling and price transmission relationships are described for electricity, hydrogen, carbon and green certificate markets under dynamic prices. A bi-level bidding strategy model for the joint electricity-hydrogen-carbon-green certificate market is constructed. Finally, the model was tested on a modified IEEE 9-bus grid and a 7-node hydrogen network, showing that the introduction of the carbon emissions trading and green certificate market improves the total return of virtual power plant aggregated waste gasification plants by about 798 parts per thousand. The scheme proposed improves the economic efficiency of waste resource treatment and enhances synergies between various energy markets, while facilitating stable grid integration of renewable energy sources, with a broad development perspective.

AB In this study, a strain sensor via two-component polyurethane was introduced. The sensor has a laminated structure composed of an amino functional silane KH-550/short-hydroxyl multi-wall carbon nanotube (SHMWCNTs) layer and a graphene nanoplates (GNs)/silver nanoparticles(Ag)/silicone rubber (SR) layer. The hydrogen bonding between layers imparted high tensile strength (650%), wide linear sensing region (0-400%), high linearity, high response rate, low detection limit (0.5%) and long-term durability to the proposed resistive strain sensor. The strain sensor was affixed to data bands and a data glove for monitoring human body motions, including finger joint, knee joint, and calf movements. Furthermore, the gait detection was performed. Owing to the advantages of the laminated strain sensor, namely, its simple preparation process and excellent electrical properties, new avenues are expected to be opened for research on strain sensors in wearable and flexible electronics.

AB Carrier gas hot extraction (CGHE) is a commonly applied technique for determination of hydrogen in weld joints using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for hydrogen measurement. The CGHE is based on the accelerated hydrogen effusion due to thermal activation at elevated temperatures. The ISO 3690 standard suggests different specimen geometries as well as necessary minimum extraction time vs. temperature. They have the biggest influence on precise hydrogen determination. The present study summarizes the results and experience of numerous test runs with different specimen temperatures, geometries (ISO 3690 type B and small cylindrical samples), and factors that additionally influence hydrogen determination. They are namely specimen surface (polished/as-welded), limited TCD sensitivity vs. specimen volume, temperature measurement vs. effects of PI-furnace controller, as well as errors due to insufficient data assessment. Summarized, the temperature is the driving force of the CGHE. Two different methods are suggested to increase the heating rate up to the desired extraction temperature without changing the experimental equipment. Suggestions are made to improve the reliability of hydrogen determination depended on the hydrogen signal stability during extraction accompanied by evaluation of the recorded data. Generally, independent temperature measurement with dummy specimens is useful for further data analysis, especially if this data is used for calculation of trapping kinetics by thermal desorption analysis (TDA).

AB The influence of moisture absorption on the weldability of carbon-fiber-reinforced Polyamide 66 (C-f/PA66) was investigated via ultrasonic welding in a lap-joint configuration. Results showed the joint strength decreased significantly when moisture absorption was up to 1 wt-% and decreased slightly with low moisture. The water molecules decreased the hydrogen bridge bond in polymer chains, which not only plasticized the composite but also changed the loss modulus of the composite. The fracture surface observations showed the increase in moisture resulted in a decreased weld area, increased voids, and severe deformation around the voids, especially for high moisture content (> 1 wt-%). As a result, the joint with high moisture exhibited interfacial fracture. This deleterious effect of moisture on the weldability of C-f/PA66 can be reversed by completely redrying before welding. The amplitude during welding decreased with increasing moisture and displayed a similar varying tendency as that of tensile strength and weld area of joint. The joint strength increased linearly with the amplitude and was influenced slightly by moisture when the amplitude was larger than 100 mu m during welding. Therefore, the amplitude was proposed as an indication in monitoring weld quality.

AB Hydrogen-induced damage is an inevitable challenge in pipeline safety applications, especially, the fusion welded joints owing to microstructure heterogeneity caused by welding process. In this work, X100 pipeline steel was subjected to friction stir welding (FSW) at rotation rates of 300-600 rpm under water cooling, and the relationship among the microstructure, hydrogen diffusivity, and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of the nugget zone (NZ) were studied. The NZ at 600 rpm had the highest effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient (Deff) of 2.1 x 10-10 m2/s because of the highest dislocation density and lowest ratio of effective grain boundary. The Deff decreased with decreasing rotation rate due to the decrease of dislocation density and the increase of ratio of effective grain boundary, and the lowest Deff of 1.32 x 10-10 m2/s was obtained at 300 rpm. After hydrogen charging, the tensile strength of all specimens decreased slightly, while the elongation decreased significantly. As the rotation rate decreased, the elongation loss was obviously inhibited, and ultimately a lowest elongation loss of 31.8% was obtained at 300 rpm. The abovementioned excellent mechanical properties were attributed to the fine ferrite/ martensite structure, low Deff, and strong {111}//ND texture dramatically inhibiting hydrogen-induced cracking initiation and propagation.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB High strength steel welded joints are usually fabricated by heterogeneous weld metal for reducing the negative impacts of microstructural characteristics and defects on mechanical properties, such as hydrogen embrittlement cracking, joint toughness decreasing, etc. To reflect material heterogeneity in the mechanical characteristics, two kinds of weld filler material are selected to obtain Evenmatched Welded Material (E-WM) and Undermatched Welded Material (U-WM) marine Ni-Cr-Mo-V steel welded joints. The Fatigue Crack Growth (FCG) behaviors of Base Metal (BM) and related welded joints are investigated considering load ratio (0.1, 0.4, 0.7) and specimen state (as-welded and heat-treated) effects. The experimental FCG trends for BM and weldments have been compared with the trends available in standards. The FCG rate (da/dN) results show the U-WM demonstrates higher FCGR curves than BM and E-WM. Additionally, it demonstrates no significant difference about FCGR for E-WM and U-WM under high R-ratios (0.4 and 0.7). Moreover, both E-WM and U-WM in as-welded state presents higher fatigue crack propagation resistance than in the Post Welded Heat Treatment (PWHT) state. The fracture mechanism of FCG was analyzed according to the fatigue crack trajectory in microstructures and fractography. Transgranular fracture behavior were observed with some secondary particles in E-WM, while the intergranular fracture was exhibited with few tiny secondary microcracks in U-WM.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), normally used in the prevention of local bacterial infection, is also used for clinical debridement in bone and joint surgery. Studies show that treatment with H2O2 can cause cartilage damage, leading to postoperative complications. H2O2 can induce apoptosis because of its strong oxidation activity. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of H2O2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, the rat chondrocytes from the knee joint were used as a cell model for this study. The results showed that the H2O2-treated cells survived at a decreased rate, with apoptosis in a great number of chondrocytes. The expression of pro-apoptotic factors of chondrocytes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, were downregulated, while the pro-apoptotic factor Bax upregulated. Two important factors ERK and p38 in MAPK signaling pathway were phosphorylated at a higher level, leading to apoptosis of chondrocytes. This study described the molecular mechanism of H2O2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, providing a theoretical basis for the rational and clinical use of H2O2 as a disinfectant.

AB 5052 Al and carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 composite (CF-PA6) were jointed via ultrasonic welding with the assistance of temperature compensation device. The effects of the ultrasonic welding time and temperature compensation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were investigated. Through analysis of the wettability and fluidity of the molten carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP), the bonding mechanism and failure path of Al/CFRTP were clarified. The results show that under the conditions of temperature compensation of 220 degrees C and welding time of 1500 ms, the joint strength of the two components reaches 2480.4 N, which is 813.6% higher than that of Al/CFRTP components obtained at room temperature. Overall, temperature compensation prolonged the wetting time of molten CFRTP on the aluminum alloy surface. When the fluidity and wettability were coordinated with each other, a high-quality joint was formed. In addition, the ultrasonic welding process of Al/CFRTP mainly relies on "physical adsorption," "diffusion effect," and "mechanical locking effect" to achieve sufficient bonding, and the effect of hydrogen bonding is weak.

AB Currently, no systematic approach exists for the safety assessment method of hydrogen transmission low-strength pipeline, it is necessary to study the effect of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) on the method of failure assessment diagram (FAD) for the defective pipe. The hydrogen charging experiments of tensile and Charpy impact specimens for the L245 pipe steel were carried out with charging time of 0, 30, 90, and 120 h, and then the tensile and Charpy impact tests were immediately conducted. The HE indexes of tensile and Charpy impact properties were presented to quantitatively analyze the effect of HE under tensile and impact deformation processes. Subsequently, the FAD method coupled with the effect of HE was investigated to analyze the difference in the safety assessment method between hydrogen and non-hydrogen environments. Finally, the fracture morphology of tensile and Charpy impact specimens was observed to analyze the responses of microscopic fracture modes between hydrogen and non-hydrogen environments. The results show that the effect of HE on the tensile properties of the base material is more sensitive than that of the weld joint. The FAC with the effect of HE for safety assessment of defective pipes shrinks by reducing the safe zone. The decrease ratio of safety factors affected by HE presents an increasing tendency as the increase of crack depth while showing a decreasing tendency as the increase of internal pressure.

AB The rule of triple joints has recently been proved for two-dimensional phase diagrams and two-dimensional sections of phase diagrams of a higher dimension (Antonov, 2013). The present paper is extending this rule to phase diagrams of binary metal-hydrogen systems composed of a metal immersed in a hydrogen gas. The rule is shown to be valid for every triple point in the temperature-pressure phase diagrams of these systems, including the points with the intersecting boundary lines tangent to each other. The paper also considers the sufficient conditions for the application of the rule to triple points in the projections of phase diagrams onto the temperature-concentration plane.

AB In the context of energy crisis, the use of MoS2 for photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen is very attractive. The narrow light absorption range and rapid carrier recombination are the key issues limiting the photocatalytic performance of MoS2. The heterostructure CdS/MoS2/CNFs composite catalyst was prepared by electrospinning, high-temperature calcination and solvothermal method. The composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), and 1.0-CMC exhibits an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 3195.52 mu molg(-1)h(- 1), which is 17 times that of pure MoS2. The results demonstrate that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the joint effect of the heterojunction structure and flake MoS2. (1) The compact heterojunction structure is formed between CdS and MoS2, which greatly improves the transfer rate of photogenerated carriers. (2) The flake MoS2 provides abundant active sites and promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work prepared a new type of nano-photocatalytic material, which has great potential in the application of photocatalytic hydrogen production.

AB This study aims to investigate the impact of various surface conditions prior to welding on the susceptibility of materials to cold cracking, including an analysis of fracture surfaces. Additionally, a novel method is introduced for quantifying the presence of diffusible hydrogen using thermal desorption analysis (TDA). This method allows for the determination of diffusible hydrogen concentration in thin sheet welded joints without use of welding consumables. Three different cold-rolled Advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) samples with different surface conditions, such as coatings, lubrication, or water, are examined to assess their susceptibility to cold cracking. In addition to measuring the diffusible hydrogen content in both the base material and the coating, the overall hydrogen content of the base material is also measured using the melt extraction (ME) method. The new method for quantifying diffusible hydrogen in weld metal is applied to investigate different welding variations, intentionally introducing hydrogen through coatings and hydrogenous fluids on the sheet surface. By combining the assessment of cracking susceptibility and hydrogen content, a better understanding of critical hydrogen levels leading to hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) is achieved. The results of this study demonstrate that the occurrence of cold cracking in specific AHSS samples increases when either lubrication or both coating and water or lubricant are added. Additionally, the presence of diffusible hydrogen in the welds of all materials is found to increase with the introduction of hydrogenous layers to the material. Although a critical hydrogen content is identified, no clear correlation between the amount of hydrogen and cracking susceptibility can be determined. These findings have significant implications for the welding of cold-formed AHSS, particularly in the automotive industry where safety and lightweight design are of paramount importance.

AB In this work, the influence of hydrogen on the microstructure and fracture toughness of API 5L X80 high strength pipeline steel welded by friction stir welding was assessed. Samples were hydrogenated at room temperature for a duration of 10 h in a solution of 0.1 M H2SO4 + 10 mg L-1 As2O3, with an intensity current of 20 mA cm(-2). Fracture toughness tests were performed at 0 degrees C in single-edged notched bending samples, using the Critical Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) parameter. Notches were positioned in different regions within the joint, such as the stir zone, hard zone, and base material. Hydrogen induces internal stress between bainite packets and ferrite plates within bainite packets. Besides, hydrogen acted as a reducer of the strain capacity of the three zones. The base metal had a moderate capacity to resist stable crack growth, displaying a ductile fracture mechanism. While the hard zone showed a brittle behavior with CTOD values below the acceptance limits for pipeline design (0.1-0.2 mm). The fracture toughness of the stir zone is higher than that of the base metal. Nevertheless, the stir zone displayed higher data dispersion due to its high inhomogeneity. Hence, it can also show a brittle behavior with critical CTOD values. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arthritis, a common joint disease, has acquired extensive attention from researchers due to its high incidence and still difficult to treat. Hydrogen sulfide, a typical anti-oxidative stress signaling molecule, plays a key role in maintaining redox homeostasis and we therefore speculate that H2S is closely associated with arthritis. In this paper, a novel near-infrared H2S fluorescent probe, NIR-Ar-H2S, was rationally designed and synthesized for visualizing the changes of H2S content in arthritis. The probe possesses many advantages such as near-infrared emission, a large Stokes shift, good optical stability, and low detection limit (0.18 mu M), which guarantees the detection of exogenous and endogenous H2S. More importantly, H2S levels were elevated in the arthritis model compared to normal joints, whereas H2S levels decreased after treatment. We expect that this finding will provide valuable guidance for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of arthritis, thereby facilitating arthritis pa-thology research and drug development.

AB The positive effect of nitrogen in the backing gas on the pitting corrosion resistance when welding duplex stainless steels with the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is discussed and the further improvement with up to 10 % hydrogen emphasised. In this work, 16 mm thick super duplex EN 1.4410/UNS S32750 was welded with three different backing gases (100 % Ar, 100 % N-2 and 90 % N-2 + 10 % H-2) in a butt joint with and without root gap. The rest of the joint was filled using the flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) process. The fillers were of ISO 25 9 4 NL type. The welds were subject to ferrite measurement, impact toughness, tensile, hardness and bend testing, while pitting corrosion resistance was determined in accordance with ASTM G48 Method E. The welds performed with 100 % Ar showed somewhat higher impact toughness, but it was only the 90 % N-2 + 10 % H-2 welds that passed the corrosion test.

AB The paper describes process development for producing sound, strong, and ductile Nb pipe-316L stainless steel (SS) flange brazed joint suitable for application in superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities. The developed transition joints, made with BVAg-8 braze filler metal (BFM), were free of brittle intermetallic compounds, in contrast to the existing global brazing practice of using oxygen-free electronic copper as BFM which results in the formation of a continuous layer of Fe-Nb brittle intermetallic compound at Nb-braze interface. In view of the large difference in the mean thermal expansion coefficients between niobium and 316L stainless steel, a new design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) has been developed to ensure achievement of desired joint thickness with uniformity in circumferential and longitudinal directions. An environment-friendly prebraze cleaning procedure has been qualified and implemented. DFMA has resulted in (i) significant reduction of the out-of-roundness errors (<= 10 mu m) while machining of the niobium pipe, (ii) simplified clearance fit prebraze assembly at room temperature (RT), and (iii) uniformity of joint thickness. A process flow chart has been developed to ensure repeatability of joint characteristics. The brazed joint, of niobium pipe and 100CF knife edge 316L SS flange made by standardized practice, displayed helium leak tightness better than 5 x 10(-10) mbar l/s at RT and at liquid helium temperature (LHT). The braze-joint sustained 873 K/10 h postbraze hydrogen degassing treatment and thermal cycling between RT and LHT without any loss in hermeticity.

AB In the present study, the influence of six different process parameters and three interactions on joint tensile strength, toughness, fusion zone microhardness variation are studied during dissimilar tungsten inert gas welding between austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 and alloy steel AISI 4340. Detailed experimental study using fractional factorial experimental design and subsequent statistical analysis show that higher tensile strength, toughness can be achieved using ER 309 filler material and suitably selecting the other process parameters and heating conditions. Addition of small proportion of hydrogen in shielding gas increases the heat transfer efficiency, melting and subsequent penetration. Preheating of AISI 4340 material reduces the chance of solidification cracking and post-heating helps to improve the joint mechanical property. Microstructural observations show that improper selection of process parameters may lead to micro-pores and degrade the joint quality. Successful joining of the dissimilar materials greatly depends on the selection of optimum process parameters, filler material and shielding gas.

AB The difficulty and long duration of start-up wastes numerous costs, labors and time and a little fluctuate during the process might fail it. However, studies dealing with the problem hindering accelerated start-up are still insufficient. Current research focused to develop a method for accelerated start-up in an efficient way. This work outlined a novel alternative for accelerated start-up. This joint method, adding waste effluent with applying biofilm reactor, could successfully start up hydrogen production in the first 24 h via increasing ability of hydrogen producers while the control group produced little hydrogen. The two factors, biofilm formation and addition of waste effluent, expressed the combined effects on accelerated start-up. This study suggested that little molecules like quorum sensing system factors and indoles might be the crucial regulating and stimulating factors and express the accelerated start-up ability only in biofilm reactors.

AB Solder pad oxidation presents a significant challenge in electronic packaging, reducing solder wettability and compromising solder joint reliability. This study investigates the enhancement of solder joints through atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) cleaning, employing both pre- and post-treatment methods. Using a mixture of argon gas and 5% hydrogen, the APP system effectively eliminates oxides, as confirmed by the H alpha peak observed in Optical Emission Spectroscopy analysis, indicating successful hydrogen radical induction. Cross-sectional analysis via Scanning Electron Microscopy demonstrated that samples subjected to both pre- following post-treatment achieved optimal wettability, with a minimum contact angle of 29.5 degrees between solder balls and copper substrates. The pre-treatment promoted the formation of intermetallic compounds at the interface, while the post-treatment effectively removed the tin oxide shell, facilitating proper solder wetting onto the substrate and enhancing overall wetting performance. During plasma post-treatment, the oxide removal rate reached 87.47 nm/min, which is significantly faster than the copper oxide formation rate (2.29 nm/min) during reflow leading to low oxygen content (1.23%) at copper substrate surface. Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer (EPMA) analysis confirmed the absence of continuous oxide layers on both tin balls and copper surfaces, further validating the improvement in wettability. This study underscores the efficiency of APP cleaning in minimizing oxidation and enhancing solder wettability, providing valuable insights for optimizing plasma cleaning techniques to ensure superior solder ability and reliability in electronic packaging.

AB We investigated the hydrogen distribution and desorption behavior in an electrochemically hydrogen charged binary Ni-Nb model alloy to study the role of delta phase in hydrogen embrittlement of alloy 718. We focus on two aspects, namely, (1) mapping the hydrogen distribution with spatial resolution enabling the observation of the relations between desorption profiles and desorption sites; and (2) correlating these observations with mechanical testing results to reveal the degradation mechanisms. The trapping states of hydrogen in the alloy were globally analyzed by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). Additionally, spatially resolved hydrogen mapping was conducted using silver decoration, Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS): The Ag decoration method revealed rapid effusion of hydrogen at room temperature from the gamma-matrix. The corresponding kinetics was resolved in both, space and time by the SKPFM measurements. At room temperature the hydrogen release from the gamma-matrix steadily decreased until about 100 h and then was taken over by the delta phase from which the hydrogen was released much slower. For avoiding misinterpretation of hydrogen signals stemming from environmental effects we also charged specimens with deuterium. The deuterium distribution in the microstructure was studied by SIMS. The combined results reveal that hydrogen dissolves more preferably inside the gamma-matrix and is diffusible at room temperature while the delta phase acts as a deeper trapping site for hydrogen. With this joint and spatially resolving approach we observed the microstructure- and time-dependent distribution and release rate of hydrogen with high spatial and temporal resolution. Correlating the obtained results with mechanical testing of the hydrogen-charged samples shows that hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) occurring at the delta/matrix interfaces promotes the embrittlement.

AB Hydrogen represents a clean and storable energy solution that could meet worldwide energy demands and reduce greenhouse gases emission. The joint research project (JRP) 'Metrology for sustainable hydrogen energy applications' addresses standardisation needs through pre- and co-normative metrology research in the fast emerging sector of hydrogen fuel that meet the requirements of the European Directive 2014/94/EU by supplementing the revision of two ISO standards that are currently too generic to enable a sustainable implementation of hydrogen. The hydrogen purity dispensed at refueling points should comply with the technical specifications of ISO 14687-2 for fuel cell electric vehicles. The rapid progress of fuel cell technology now requires revising this standard towards less constraining limits for the 13 gaseous impurities. In parallel, optimized validated analytical methods are proposed to reduce the number of analyses. The study aims also at developing and validating traceable methods to assess accurately the hydrogen mass absorbed and stored in metal hydride tanks; this is a research axis for the revision of the ISO 16111 standard to develop this safe storage technique for hydrogen. The probability of hydrogen impurity presence affecting fuel cells and analytical techniques for traceable measurements of hydrogen impurities will be assessed and new data of maximum concentrations of impurities based on degradation studies will be proposed. Novel validated methods for measuring the hydrogen mass absorbed in hydrides tanks AB, AB2 and AB5 types referenced to ISO 16111 will be determined, as the methods currently available do not provide accurate results. The outputs here will have a direct impact on the standardisation works for ISO 16111 and ISO 14687-2 revisions in the relevant working groups of ISO/TC 197 'Hydrogen technologies'.

ID RECOMMENDATIONS; PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS
AB As part of the global transition to low-carbon energy systems, the accelerated construction of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations plays a vital role in supporting the uptake of hydrogen-powered transport. Ensuring the safety and reliability of these facilities is therefore increasingly critical. While various risk assessment models have been developed, the systematic analysis of real-world operational experience is still underrepresented in the literature. This study addresses that gap by expanding the analysis of the Japanese KHK accident database through a newly developed typology that captures not only the causes and types of hydrogen releases but also the role of safety barriers and emergency responses. The findings highlight that most hydrogen leakage accidents occurred during normal operation, with a significant number also arising during inspections and testing. Common causes included equipment failures, particularly in valves, joints, and seals, as well as human errors. Dispensers, compressors, and storage units were frequently involved. Although fixed and portable detectors were vital for leak identification, reliance on low-tech methods and operator vigilance remained essential due to occasional detection failures. Overall, the study underscores the need for both technical and organisational improvements, such as system redundancies, revised maintenance practices, and institutional learning, to enhance overall hydrogen station safety.

AB We analyze the mechanical properties of heat-resistant steels after long-term operation at thermal power plants. It is shown that the operating conditions (high temperature and pressure of hydrogenating corrosive media, thermal and mechanical stresses) negatively affect their structural-mechanical state. We generalize the results of evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of steels after their operation in various elements (straight sections, pipe bends, and welded joints) of the main steam pipelines of thermal power plants under the joint influence of the in-service factors. On this basis, we rank the analyzed steels according to their sensitivity to high-temperature hydrogen degradation.

AB The additive manufactured (AM) parts of aluminum alloys have been widely used in defense, aerospace, automotive and other industries. There is a growing demand for joining or repairing of the AM parts of aluminum alloys using welding technology. However, the problems of high porosity and joint softening are occurred when welding of aluminum alloy AM parts, which have become technical bottlenecks that need to be solved urgently. Laser welding of AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) with an addition of Er and Zr in the filler metal was carried out. The effect of Er and Zr addition on the porosity, microstructures and mechanical properties of the welded joints was investigated, and the contribute of Er and Zr addition to the yield strength (YS) of the welded joints was calculated. Compared that joints without Er and Zr addition, the average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and YS of the welded joints with Er and Zr addition have been increased by 10.5% and 23.5%, respectively. The improved mechanical poverty of the welded joints is due to the refined alpha-Al grains and Si-rich cellular networks, and the reduced hydrogen pores occurred in the weld metal (WM) with the addition of Er and Zr. The YS calculation of the weld joints indicates the most important contribution to the YS is the enhancement effect of the Si-rich networks with Er and Zr.

AB Microstructure, tensile property, microhardness and fracture behavior of the hydrogenated Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) joints were investigated. The results show that the microstructure of the hydrogenated 0.21 wt.% H weld zone were composed of alternating lamellar alpha/needle-like transformed beta and the hydride. Transformed beta was secondary decomposed into the short rod-shaped secondary alpha and lamellar residual beta. The "Pinning" effect of the hydride and more difficult dislocations cross slip directly led to the increased ultimate tensile and yield strength. Average hardness of weld zone, heat affected zone and base metal for the hydrogenated specimens were 196, 177 and 169 HV respectively. Hardness of the former was greater than that of the latter two, hydrogen-induced hardness of the welded joint was significantly increased. Fracture mode of the hydrogenated welded joints changed from the single ductile fracture to mainly brittle fracture with a few dimples fracture. Main cracks that propagated alternately to the original beta grain boundary resulted in local fracture of the microstructure, the interconnected local fractures finally led to the overall fracture of the hydrogenated welded joint.

AB Dissimilar joining of mild steel and Fe-7% Al alloy was carried out using electron beam welding (EBW) process under three different weld operating conditions such as with beam oscillations, without beam oscillations and at higher welding speeds. Laboratory based X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was used for three dimensional (3D) visualisation of porosity under various welding conditions. Quantitative analysis of porosity such as the average size and number of pores were evaluated from XCT results as a function of beam oscillation and welding speed. XCT results show that the application of beam oscillation results in decrease in average size of the pores as well as a decrease in number of pores in the welded joints. Further, it was observed that an increase in weld speed results in an increase in porosity in the weld joint. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows the presence of hydrogen gas which could be responsible for porosity formation in EBW dissimilar joints. This study shows that the application of beam oscillation improves the weld quality by decreasing the porosity in the weld joints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aluminum alloy AA2219 is used for the fabrication of the liquid hydrogen (fuel, boiling point 20K) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer, boiling point 90K) propellant tanks of cryogenic engine in view of its good weldability, compatibility with propellants and excellent mechanical properties at the operating temperatures. The propellant tanks are fabricated using fine-grained thin sheet/plate, roll bent to form cylindrical shells and are welded to large coarse-grained intermediate/end seamless ring-rolled products. The integrity of the weld joints and the mechanical properties need to be ascertained for the joints with coarse- and fine-grained microstructures to demonstrate the safety margins on the tank design. Therefore, detailed experiments were conducted to study the effect of grain size and grain aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of AA 2219 parent and weld specimens, at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. It was found that reliable joints could be fabricated and there was no significant effect of grain size or aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of weld joints either at room temperature (300K) or at 77K.

AB Photocatalysis, as a technology for splitting water to produce hydrogen, has been paid more and more attention. However, the catalyst has fewer active sites and a fast carrier recombination rate resulting in lower activity. In this work, BiOBr-Ni with Ni single atoms and oxygen vacancies was prepared by the microwave - assisted method. The SEM results show that the BiOBr-Ni surface layer is composed of nano-sheets. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicates that the prepared BiOBr-Ni contains oxygen vacancies. XRD, XPS and spherical electron microscopy have proved that Ni exists in the form of single atom. In the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production, BiOBr-Ni showed excellent photocatalytic activity. DFT and experimental tests show that the improved photocatalytic hydrogen production is the joint action of oxygen vacancy and Ni single atom, which not only enhances the carrier separation efficiency but also greatly reduces the reaction energy barrier.

AB Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the formation and deposition of calcium-containing crystals in joint tissues, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been implicated in mineralization but has never been studied in OA. Here, we investigated the role of the H2S-producing enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in cartilage calcification and OA development. Methods 3-MST expression was analyzed in cartilage from patients with different OA degrees, and in cartilage stimulated with hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals. The modulation of 3-MST expression in vivo was studied in the meniscectomy (MNX) model of murine OA, by comparing sham-operated to MNX knee cartilage. The role of 3-MST was investigated by quantifying joint calcification and cartilage degradation in WT and 3-MST-/- meniscectomized knees. Chondrocyte mineralization in vitro was measured in WT and 3-MST-/- cells. Finally, the effect of oxidative stress on 3-MST expression and chondrocyte mineralization was investigated. Results 3-MST expression in human cartilage negatively correlated with calcification and OA severity, and diminished upon HA stimulation. In accordance, cartilage from menisectomized OA knees revealed decreased 3-MST if compared to sham-operated healthy knees. Moreover, 3-MST-/- mice showed exacerbated joint calcification and OA severity if compared to WT mice. In vitro, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of 3-MST in chondrocytes resulted in enhanced mineralization and IL-6 secretion. Finally, oxidative stress decreased 3-MST expression and increased chondrocyte mineralization, maybe via induction of pro-mineralizing genes. Conclusion 3-MST-generated H2S protects against joint calcification and experimental OA. Enhancing H2S production in chondrocytes may represent a potential disease modifier to treat OA.

AB The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has legislated and aims to be net zero emissions by 2045. Such ambitious targets have implications for the contribution of hydrogen and its storage in gas distribution networks Therefore, we need to understand now the impacts on the gas distribution network of the transition to 100% hydrogen. Assessment of the viability of decarbonising the ACT gas network will be partly based on the cost of reusing the gas network for the safe and reliable distribution of hydrogen. That task requires each element of the natural gas safety management system to be evaluated. This article describes the construction of a test facility in Canberra, Australia used to identify issues raised by 100% hydrogen use in the medium pressure distribution network, consisting of nylon and polyethylene (PE) as a means of identifying measures necessary to ensure ongoing validity of the network's regulatory safety case. Evoenergy (the ACT's gas distribution company) have constructed a Test Facility, incorporating an electrolyser, a gas supply pressure reduction and mixing skid a replica gas network and a domestic installation with gas appliances. Jointly with Australian National University (ANU) and Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) the Company has commenced a program of "bench testing", initially with 100% hydrogen to identify gaps in the safety case specifically focusing on the materials, work practices and safety systems in the ACT. The facility is designed to assess: Materials in use including aged network materials and components Construction and installation techniques both greenfield and live gas work Purging and filling techniques Leak detection both underground and above ground Emergency response and make safe techniques Issues associated with use of hydrogen in light commercial and domestic appliances. To educate and train: Technicians and gas fitters on infrastructure installation and management Emergency response services on responding to hydrogen related emergencies in a network environment; and manage public perceptions of hydrogen in a network environment. Australia has an enviable safety record for the safe and reliable transport, distribution and use of natural gas. The ACT natural gas network owned and operated by Evoenergy is one of the newest in Australia and has leveraged off the best materials and practices in Australia to build its network. The paper addresses major safety issues relating to the production/storage, distribution and consumer end use of hydrogen injected into existing gas distribution networks. The analysis is guided by the Safety Management System. The Hydrogen Testing Facility described in the paper provide tools for evaluation of hydrogen safety matters in the ACT and Australia-wide. Testing to date has confirmed that polyethylene and nylon pipe and their respective jointing techniques can contain 100% hydrogen at pressures used for the distribution of natural gas. Testing has also confirmed that current installation work practices on polyethylene and nylon pipe and joints are suitable for hydrogen service. This finding is subject to variation attributable to staff training and skill levels and further testing has been programmed as outlined in this paper. Testing of gas isolation by clamping and simulated repair on the hydrogen network has established that standard natural gas isolation techniques work with 100% hydrogen at natural gas pressures.

AB Micro-alloy steels are broadly used in gas and petroleum transportation industries. However, application of these steels in pipelines is challenged by hydrogen embrittlement due to presence of hydrogen sulfide in the medium. The present work deals with the interaction of hydrogen with plasticity of X65 steel. Two weld joints produced by common E7010-G and E7018 electrodes via shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) method were also investigated. It was revealed in microhardness test that direct charge of hydrogen to the surface did not lead to meaningful variations due to lamination as well as surface and sub-surface porosities. In fact, the effect of hydrogen on material plasticity was influenced by lamination and porosities. On the other hand, indirect charge on the tested surface led to increase in hardness by 12%, 9% and 6% in base metal as well as in weld metals obtained from E7010-G and E7018 electrodes, respectively. Therefore, hydrogen atoms affected plasticity of X65 steel more harshly than that of weld metals; thus, the base metal is more sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement. Due to high strain rate, impact test does not provide sufficient time for hydrogen diffusion through notch during the test. No observation of any variations in impact energies of charged samples may hence be explained by uniform hydrogen concentration throughout the samples. The base steel was seen to be much more sensitive to hydrogen defects rather than weld metals of both electrodes due to possessing pearlite/ ferrite interfaces. According to hydrogen concentration studies, E710-G weld metal had more hydrogen diffusivity than X65 steel and E7018 weld metal by four time and 25%, respectively. This was due to acicular ferritic microstructure of E710-G weld metal and its dislocation tangles that provided many reversible traps for hydrogen.

AB With the transition towards a decarbonized society, energy system integration is becoming ever more essential. In this transition, the energy vector hydrogen is expected to play a key role as it can be produced from (renewable) power and natural gas with carbon capture and storage and utilized in a plethora of applications and processes across sectors. Despite global hydrogen demand reaching 94 million tonnes in 2021, still less than 0.7% of it is supplied by low-emission hydrogen. Moreover, to date hydrogen production is mostly located in close proximity to where it is used. In order to link future production and demand sites, it is planned to re-purpose existing natural gas and expand dedicated hydrogen pipelines. During the early stages of ramping up the hydrogen sector (2020s and early 2030s), however, blending natural gas with hydrogen for joint pipeline transmission has been suggested. Against this background, this paper studies hydrogen blending from a modeling perspective, both in terms of the implications of considering (or omitting) technical modeling details and in terms of the potential impact on the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector. To this end, we present a highly modular and flexible integrated sector-coupled energy system optimization model of the power, natural gas, and hydrogen sectors with a novel gas flow formulation for modeling blending in the context of steady-state gas flows. A stylized case study illustrates that hydrogen blending has the potential to initiate and to facilitate the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector under certain assumptions, while omitting the technical realities of gas flows - particularly in the context of blending - can result in suboptimal expansion planning not only in the hydrogen, but also in the power sector, as well as in an operationally infeasible system.

AB This paper describes a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work was funded by the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very little is known about the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31 m(3) passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the vent area sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the vent area was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated: The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively ventilated enclosure.depends on the hydrogen release rate, the vent area and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and vent area, whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated.

AB Urea (CN2H4O) is a fundamental biomolecule whose derivatives are abundant throughout chemistry. Among the latter, rubidium ureate (RbCN2H3O) and its cesium analog (CsCN2H3O) have been described only very recently and form the first structurally characterized salts of deprotonated urea. Here, we report on a neutron diffraction study on the aforementioned alkaline-metal ureates, which affords the positions for all hydrogen atoms (including full anisotropic displacement tensors) and thus allows us to gain fundamental insights into the hydrogen-bonding networks in the title compounds. The structure refinements of the experimental neutron data proceeded successfully using starting parameters from ab initio simulations of atomic positions and anisotropic displacement parameters. Such joint experimental-theoretical refinement procedures promise significant practical potential in cases where complex solids (organic, organometallic, framework materials) are studied by powder diffraction.

AB The potential of neutron powder diffraction (NPD) to provide vital information on the determination of accurate hydrogen positions in organic molecular crystals is demonstrated through the study of a series of hydrogen bonded molecular complexes with relevance in crystal engineering. By studying complexes designed to contain short, strong hydrogen bonds, the findings are shown to be of particular importance in the study of proton transfer, and the often critical distinction between neutral complexes and salts in these molecular materials. The use of combined NPD and single crystal X-ray diffraction is shown to be particularly potent in this area.

AB We observed the effect of hydrogen-rich medium on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), hyaline leukocyte conglutination, and permeability of the endothelium. Endotheliocytes were inoculated on 6-well plates and randomly divided into 4 groups: control, H-2, LPS, LPS+H-2, H-2, and LPS+H-2 in saturated hydrogen-rich medium. We applied Wright's staining to observe conglutination of hyaline leukocytes and HUVECs, flow cytometry to determine the content of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), enzymelinked immunosorbent assay to measure the E-selectin concentration in the cell liquor, the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) to test the permeability of endothelial cells, and Western blot and immunofluorescence to test the expression and distribution of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Compared with control cells, there was an increase in endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, and the TEER value increased obviously. Compared with LPS, there was an obvious reduction in the conglutination of LPS+H-2 cells, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin levels, and a reduction in the TEER-resistance value, while the expression of VE-cadherin increased. Fluorescence results showed that, compared with control cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS cells was incomplete at the cell joints. Compared with LPS cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS+H-2 cells was even and complete at the cell joints. Liquid rich in hydrogen could reduce LPS-induced production of adhesion molecules and endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, and influence the expression and distribution of VE-cadherin to regulate the permeability of the endothelium.

AB This paper presents a high-efficiency and high-fidelity approach to model supersonic combustion using the extended flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) and the Eulerian transported probability density function (PDF), also known as the Eulerian stochastic fields (ESF) method. The efficiency benefits from the FGM, where the compressibility effects induced by shock waves are considered using two extra control variables, i.e., the pressure (p) and the absolute internal energy of the oxidizer (Eox), in addition to the mixture fraction (Z) and progress variable (Y) in traditional flamelet tables. The joint PDF for these control variables is modeled using transported PDF based on the ESF method. The ESF method enhances accuracy in the prediction of turbulence-chemistry interactions, avoiding complexity induced by the presumed PDF in the flamelet table and ad-hoc presumed and independent joint PDF assumptions, e.g., the typical presumed /3-PDF for Z and S-PDF for Y. This FGM-ESF method is tested in large eddy simulations of two canonical hydrogen supersonic flames: a strut-stabilized hydrogen supersonic flame (DLR case) and a transverse hydrogen jet flame in a high-enthalpy incoming flow (Stanford case). For both cases, results show that including the compressibility effects in the FGM table is essential for properly describing the flame behaviors near shock waves. The sub-grid PDF of control variables significantly influences near-wall and shear-layer combustion, and the ESF method demonstrates superior performance in predicting the near-wall reaction zone and the shear-layer reaction zone compared to the perfectly micro-mixed sub-grid model (S-PDF) for the Stanford case. This study marks the first application of the FGM-ESF approach with a Z-Y-Eox-p FGM table to simulate supersonic flames, offering a novel perspective for future modeling efforts in this domain. Novelty and Significance Statement The novelty of this research lies in the development and application of an efficient computational approach that for the first time couples the extended flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) method with the Eulerian stochastic fields (ESF) to simulate supersonic flames. This combined FGM-ESF method incorporates pressure and oxidizer energy as additional control variables in the FGM tabulation to account for compressibility effects. The ESF is used to describe the sub-grid scale joint probability density function without relying on complex presumed functions. Application to a canonical strut-stabilized hydrogen supersonic flame and transverse hydrogen jet flames in a high-enthalpy incoming flow demonstrate the superior predictive capabilities of the FGM-ESF method in capturing flame dynamics. The comparison between four-dimensional and twodimensional FGM tables provides new insights into the importance of compressibility effects for these configurations.

AB Hydrogen storage in the solid state represents one of the most attractive and challenging ways to supply hydrogen to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Although in the last 15 years a large variety of material systems have been identified as possible candidates for storing hydrogen, further efforts have to be made in the development of systems which meet the strict targets of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Recent projections indicate that a system possessing: (i) an ideal enthalpy in the range of 20-50 kJ/mol H-2, to use the heat produced by PEM fuel cell for providing the energy necessary for desorption; (ii) a gravimetric hydrogen density of 5 wt. % H-2 and (iii) fast sorption kinetics below 110 degrees C is strongly recommended. Among the known hydrogen storage materials, amide and imide-based mixtures represent the most promising class of compounds for on-board applications; however, some barriers still have to be overcome before considering this class of material mature for real applications. In this review, the most relevant progresses made in the recent years as well as the kinetic and thermodynamic properties, experimentally measured for the most promising systems, are reported and properly discussed.

AB To achieve the sustainability goals set for the European aviation sector, hydrogen-powered solutions are currently being investigated. Storage solutions are of particular interest, with liquid hydrogen tanks posing numerous challenges with regard to the structural integrity of materials at cryogenic temperatures, as well as safety issues because of the high flammability of hydrogen. In this context and in the scope of the Horizon 2020 Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU) project H2ELIOS, the gas permeability behavior of prepreg tape carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) material was studied. Investigations were performed after thermal shock to 20 K (liquid hydrogen immersion) as well as after a uniaxial stress application at 77 K to identify the shift from Fickian behavior after diverse aging conditions. Helium gas permeation was tested at room temperature (RT), and its representativeness to hydrogen permeation in a range of temperatures was considered in the study. The material's permeation behavior was compared to ideal Fickian diffusion as a means of identifying related permeation barrier function degradation. Finally, it was possible to identify Fickian, near-Fickian, and non-Fickian behaviors and correlate them with the material's preconditioning.

AB CdS/TiO2 composite photoanode has attracted great attention due to its favorable electronic and optical properties. In this work, nanostructured Si-doped TiO2 photoanodes modified with CdS were fabricated through anodization of Ti-5Si alloy and depositing CdS by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. The composition and morphology, optical properties and photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the composite photoanodes were investigated. The CdS/600-TiSiO composite photoanode with donor density of 2.2 x 1019 cm-3 and flat-band potential of -0.215 V exhibited excellent PEC hydrogen generation properties with remarkable photocurrent density (7.86 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl), which was 19.15 times and 9.59 times to that of undoped TiO2 photoanode and Ti-Si-O photoanode, respectively. The joint employment of Si-doping and CdS deposition provided an effective method to prepare excellent photocatalysts for PEC hydrogen generation. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The development of 100% renewable energy (RE) systems provides a viable solution for achieving the global target of carbon neutrality. To support the reliable and economical operation of RE -based local energy networks, this paper presents a joint scheduling model for grid -scale RE generation and hydrogen -based flexible loads. The direct load control (DLC) through hydrogen -electrical microgrids is analytically modeled for leveraging the intrinsic flexibility of demand -side multi -energy synergy. To handle the uncertainty and volatility of RE generation, a risk -averse stochastic programming method with the receding -horizon mechanism is developed. Also, the power balancing cost in scheduling objectives is represented as a conditional value -atrisk (CVaR) measure to control the risks of fully RE supply. Case studies on an exemplary RE system confirm the effectiveness and economic benefits of the proposed method. The hydrogen -enabled DLC can largely mitigate the supply-demand mismatches, which shows a great potential to facilitate 100% RE scenarios.

AB In general, wind power output of clustering wind farms must be massively transmitted. The wind power in each wind farm is correlated, intermittent, fluctuant, and cannot be accommodated all the time, causing the intractable decision of economical transmission capacity of a project transmitting wind power to a power grid. Furthermore, the drastic fluctuation of clustered wind power results in enormous challenges regarding the safety of a power system. For these reasons, the concept of a wind-hydrogen power system for clustered wind farms is proposed. Next, a multiobjective model for optimizing the capacities, including the transmission project, hydrogen-producing system, and fuel cells, is constructed based on the joint distributed character of wind speed, which consists of maximizing social benefit and the qualified rate of smoothing clustering wind power fluctuations. Finally, a case is analyzed in detail, accounting for the wind volatility, wind curtailment probability, and the costs of both hydrogen production and the fuel cells.

AB Hydrogen energy represents a crucial pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality and is a pivotal facet of future strategic emerging industries. The safe and efficient transportation of hydrogen is a key link in the entire chain development of the hydrogen energy industry's "production, storage, and transportation". Mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines for transportation is the potential best way to achieve large-scale, long-distance, safe, and efficient hydrogen transportation. Welds are identified as the vulnerable points in natural gas pipelines, and compatibility between hydrogen-doped natural gas and existing pipeline welds is a critical technical challenge that affects the global-scale transportation of hydrogen energy. Therefore, this article systematically discusses the construction and weld characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines, the research status of hydrogen damage mechanism, and mechanical property strengthening methods of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds, and points out the future development direction of hydrogen damage mechanism research in hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. The research results show that: (1) Currently, there is a need for comprehensive research on the degradation of mechanical properties in welds made from typical pipe materials on a global scale. It is imperative to systematically elucidate the mechanism of mechanical property degradation due to conventional and hydrogen-induced damage in welds of high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines worldwide. (2) The deterioration of mechanical properties in welds of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines is influenced by various components, including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. It is necessary to reveal the mechanism of mechanical property deterioration of pipeline welds under the joint participation of multiple damage mechanisms under multi-component gas conditions. (3) Establishing a fundamental database of mechanical properties for typical pipeline steel materials under hydrogen-doped natural gas conditions globally is imperative, to form a method for strengthening the mechanical properties of typical high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. (4) It is essential to promptly develop relevant standards for hydrogen blending transportation, welding technology, as well as weld evaluation, testing, and repair procedures for natural gas pipelines.

The corrosion rate was found to increase, in order, Al base metal (BM-6N01) < Mg base metal (BM-AZ31B) < stirred zone. The galvanic coupling of the Mg phase to the other phases enhanced the corrosion of both BM-AZ31B and BM-6N01. Accompanying the intense corrosion at BM-AZ31B, water reduction on the cathodic particles of BM-6N01 elevated the interfacial pH to a level where the Al matrix corroded to AlO2-.

AB The storage of hydrogen gas in lined rock caverns (LRCs) may enable the implementation of the first large-scale fossil-free steelmaking process in Sweden, but filling such storage causes joints in the rock mass to open, concentrating strains in the lining. The structural interaction between the LRC components must be able to reduce the strain concentration in the sealing steel lining; however, this interaction is complex and difficult to predict with analytical methods. In this paper, the strain concentration in LRCs from the opening of rock joints is studied using finite element (FE) analyses, where the large- and small-scale deformation behaviors of the LRC are coupled. The model also includes concrete crack initiation and development with increasing gas pressure and rock joint width. The interaction between the jointed rock mass and the reinforced concrete, the sliding layer, and the steel lining is demonstrated. The results show that the rock mass quality and the spacing of the rock joints have the greatest influence on the strain distributions in the steel lining. The largest effect of rock joints on the maximum strains in the steel lining was observed for geological conditions of "good" quality rock masses.

AB Chemical looping gasification (CLG) has become a popular method for producing hydrogen-rich syngas due to its environment-friendliness. Recently, a method of using industrial solid waste carbide slag as an oxygen carrier, hydrogen carrier, and in-situ carbon capture agent in the CLG process has been proposed. However, the actual experiment was affected by heat and mass transfer, and the detailed reaction pathway of the carbide slag was not fully understood. In the present study, the process of the CLG process for producing hydrogen-rich syngas with lignite and carbide slag was analyzed using tube furnace experiments, FactSage calculations, and joint charac-teristic experiment of carbide slag. The result showed that to achieve a gas phase product with a hydrogen concentration exceeding 90 vol% (with dry N2 excluded), a molar ratio of lignite to carbide slag of greater than 1:5 and a reaction temperature of 923 K should be maintained. In terms of the reaction pathway of carbide slag in the CLG process, it was revealed that calcium hydroxide, the primary component of carbide slag, directly participated in the reaction at temperatures of less than 773 K.

AB The underground storage of hydrogen (H2) in porous formations is considered a part of the global strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion into the atmosphere. Although injection of fluids into reservoir rocks has been a common practice, the unique properties of H2 and the ubiquitous spatial variability of hydraulic medium properties require a new understanding of the multiphase flow processes involved in underground hydrogen storage. In this paper, we focus on the joint impact that spatial medium heterogeneity and hysteresis on relative permeability, as a result of capillary trapping, have on hydrogen geostorage. We present an integrated study that uses detailed 2D numerical simulations of cyclic hydrogen-brine displacement in heterogeneous anticlinal aquifers to evaluate the amount of trapped hydrogen and the reversibility of the water-hydrogen system. We find that the intensity and spatial correlation of heterogeneity in rock porosity and permeability significantly enhance the trapping potential of capillary forces. In addition to increasing the amount of trapped hydrogen, the intensity of heterogeneity also increases the number of injection-production cycles before a reversible operation mode can be achieved. Depending on the degree of heterogeneity, the amount of trapped hydrogen may be twice that of an equivalent homogeneous storage formation. We find that these effects can be mitigated by decreasing the length of injection-production cycles. Thus, the interaction between relative permeability hysteresis and spatial heterogeneity in the hydraulic medium properties plays a key role in the design and deployment of underground hydrogen storage in aquifers.

AB The process of creating a physical and mathematical model of the hydrogen permeability of a hollow cylinder, depending on the level, sign and nature of the distribution of internal stresses on the example of electrochemical alloys synthesized by electrolysis, is shown. For the concentration fields of hydrogen atoms, the corresponding analytical dependences are used, which are the basis for mathematical modeling of diffusion processes and demonstrate the possibility of controlling the hydrogen permeability of metals. It is shown that the hydrogen permeability of a hollow cylinder primarily depends on the level and nature of the distribution of internal stresses (tensile and compressive). Internal stresses with a logarithmic dependence on coordinates have a single mathematical description, and the use of the principle of superposition allows you to display a picture of the joint interactions of the fields of internal stresses of various origins. The mathematical interpretation of internal stresses in crystals is reduced to the introduction of some dimensionless parameters, which are easily calculated and algebraically summed. This allows the model to demonstrate the possibility of parametric control of internal stresses in alloys. The mathematical model of the diffusion process for a medium with the formation and decay of immovable metal-impurity-hydrogen complexes is presented taking into account the probabilities of their formation and decay.

AB The utilization of hydrogen-powered vehicles as an alternative to fossil-fueled ones has been identified as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To promote the deployment of hydrogen-powered vehicles, however, it is imperative that hydrogen refueling stations with on-site electricity-produced hydrogen (eHRSs) are economically utilized for concurrent services. Therefore, this article proposes a new estimation-based method for the optimal scheduling of eHRS for the provision of congestion management services to the distribution system. The method allows for real-time adaptive management of the congestion level in the feeder as decided by the distribution system operator. A new correlation-based method is proposed for online estimation of the amount of congestion and determination of the eHRSs setpoints to relieve congestion on the distribution feeders. This article also develops a congestion management pricing mechanism for the compensation of eHRSs that serve the distribution grid. Numerical results indicate how distribution feeder congestion can be adaptively managed, while the financial profile of the eHRSs is improved via joint application and provision of concurrent services to the transportation sector and grid operator.

AB In order to maximise European, national and regional research and innovation potential the European Union is investing in these fields through different funding mechanisms such as the ESIF or H2020 programme. This investment plan is part of the European 2020 strategy, where the concept of Smart Specialisation is also included.
   Smart Specialisation is an innovation policy concept designed to promote the efficient and effective use of public investment in regional innovation in order to achieve economic growth. The Smart Specialisation Platform was created to support this concept by assisting regions and Member States in developing, implementing and reviewing their research and innovation Smart Specialisation strategies. The Smart Specialisation Platform comprises several thematic platforms.
   The thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on energy (S3PEnergy) is a joint initiative of three European Commission services: DG REGIO, DG ENER, and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The main objective of the S3PEnergy is to support the optimal and effective uptake of the Cohesion Policy funds for energy, and to better align energy innovation activities at national, local and regional level through the identification of the technologies and innovative solutions that support in the most cost-effective way the EU energy policy priorities.
   In the particular case of hydrogen technologies, the activities of the platform are mainly focused on supporting the new Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) initiative involving regions and cities. To date, more than 80 European cities and regions have committed to participate in this initiative through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding, and more participants are expected to join. S3PEnergy is helping in the identification of potential combination of H2020 funding (provided through FCH JU) and ESIF.
   To identify potential synergies among these two funding sources, a mapping of the different ESIF opportunities has been performed. In order to map these opportunities, Operational Programmes (OPs) and research and innovation strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) of the different European regions and Member States were analysed. The results of this mapping and analysis are presented in this paper. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The multiple mortise-and-tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU-27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4 '-vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron <- nitrogen (B <- N) bonds. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU-27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight pi-pi interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock-like configuration. CityU-27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one-pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi-hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co-catalysts (metal-free).
   The single-crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU-27) with a width of ca. 6 nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple "mortise-and-tenon" like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU-27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal-free one-pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi-hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives. image

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of inflammation homeostasis disorder that dysfunctions the joints. Clinically, medications against RA focus simply on mitigating the focal inflammation, without considering pro-osteogenesis re-modeling of the bone microenvironment. In the present work, 2D layered calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) are fabricated by facile aqueous exfoliation. The hydrolysis of CSNs produces anti-oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and pro-osteogenesis resulting in considerably better RA therapeutic consequences than anti-inflammation alone. Hydrogen gas is validated to eliminate excessive hydroxyl radicals and regulate macrophage re-polarization; the generated Ca(OH)2 can neutralize the acidic microenvironment and inhibit the osteoclast activity; and, the dissolved Ca2+ can effectively complex with phosphates to mineralize Ca3(PO4)2, promoting the osteogenesis of the focal joint. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced and robust therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility and clinical transformable promises.

TI THE PHENOMENON OF HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT IN HIGH-STRENGTH BOLTS
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS

DE cold forging; hydrogen embrittlement; high -strength bolts
AB The hydrogen embrittlement of metals is caused by the penetration and accumulation of hydrogen atoms inside the metal. The failure of the product due to hydrogen embrittlement is delayed in time and does not occur immediately after its manufacture, but several hours, days, or even weeks later. Therefore, the chances of detecting hydrogen embrittlement when checking the quality of the finished product are very slim. The use of high-strength bolts in industry is associated with the risk of hydrogen embrittlement. This phenomenon poses a threat to the safe use of devices by limiting or completely losing the functionality of the bolt joint. Even a low influence of moisture can trigger failure mechanisms. The article proposes a method for assessing the risk of hydrogen embrittlement for high-strength bolts in class12.9. For this purpose, bolts made of material grade 32CrB4 were prepared and in a controlled manner the grain flow inconsistency was made, leading in extreme cases to the production of the forging lap. To perform the study, the device proposed by the European Assessment Document (EAD) was adapted to the testing of hydrogen embrittlement of threaded fasteners in concrete. The concrete substrate was replaced with metal spacers that were preloaded with a bolt. The use of the wedge distance under the bolt head led to the generation of two stress states - tensile and compressive, which translated into an increased risk of hydrogen embrittlement. After being tested, the bolts were visually and microscopically inspected to assess potential locations for cracks and hydrogen propagation. As a result of the conducted tests, it was found that the prepared test method allows to assess the resistance or susceptibility of the bolt to threats related to hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Dissimilar joining of NiTi and stainless steel (SS) is important in biomedical applications but poses significant challenges due to brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formation in the welds. Replacing harmful phases in fusion welding cannot fully eliminate brittle IMCs and may introduce toxic elements, while the mixing restriction in solid-state welding increases the process complexity and results in large plastic deformation that degrades NiTi functional properties. In this work, we present a novel methodology that achieves a solid-state joined interface in NiTi-SS fusion welding (i.e., resistance microwelding) through in-situ interfacial liquid control. By combining the advantages of both welding techniques, the current method produced NiTi-SS joints with superior strength, superelasticity and biocompatibility compared to NiTi joints or base metal. The ultrathin reaction layer at the solid-state joined interface contributed to a strong metallurgical bonding, while Joule heating effects and interfacial reactions enhanced superelasticity and biocompatibility of the joint. By demonstrating complete superelasticity on NiTi side, flexible deformation capacity on SS side, superior resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and electrochemical corrosion, and reduced Ni ion release and cytotoxicity, the welded joint shows great potential for the fabrication of multifunctional biomedical devices. Our work not only provides a comprehensive study of NiTi-SS joining under the biomedical background, but also introduces a new strategy for controlling material interface and dissimilar-metal welding process.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common articular chronic disease. However, its current treatment is limited and mostly symptomatic. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gas with recognized physiological activities. The purpose here was to evaluate the effects of the intraarticular administration of a slow-releasing H2S compound (GYY-4137) on an OA experimental model. OA was induced in Wistar rats by the transection of medial collateral ligament and the removal of the medial meniscus of the left joint. The animals were randomized into three groups: non-treated and intraarticularly injected with saline or GYY-4137. Joint destabilization induced articular thickening (approximate to 5% increment), the loss of joint mobility and flexion (approximate to 12-degree angle), and increased levels of pain (approximate to 1.5 points on a scale of 0 to 3). Animals treated with GYY-4137 presented improved motor function of the joint, as well as lower pain levels (approximate to 75% recovery). We also observed that cartilage deterioration was attenuated in the GYY-4137 group (approximate to 30% compared with the saline group). Likewise, these animals showed a reduced presence of pro-inflammatory mediators (cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and metalloproteinase-13) and lower oxidative damage in the cartilage. The increment of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) levels and Nrf-2-regulated gene expression (approximate to 30%) in the GYY-4137 group seem to be underlying its chondroprotective effects. Our results suggest the beneficial impact of the intraarticular administration of H2S on experimental OA, showing a reduced cartilage destruction and oxidative damage, and supporting the use of slow H2S-producing molecules as a complementary treatment in OA.

AB The stress corrosion cracking behaviour of laser MIG-hybrid welded 7B05-T5 aluminum alloy joint was studied by using pre-cracked wedge-open loading (WOL) specimens immersed in 3.5 %NaCl solution. The critical stress intensity factor for stress corrosion cracking (K-ISCC), and the cracks propagation rate (da/dt) were determined. The stress corrosion cracking propagation mechanism of welded joints was analyzed by fracture scanning and microstructure analysis. The results illustrated that both the base metal (BM) and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) were susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), but the weld zone (WZ) was not sensitive to SCC. The fracture mode of the aluminum alloy in SCC appeared the intergranular and transgranular mixed fracture. It was considered that the coaction of anodic dissolution and hydrogen embritt-lement contributed to SCC.

AB The concept of solar-hydrogen systems for spacecraft, orbital stations, lunar and Martian bases is currently receiving a new impetus. The supply of solar energy to energy receivers aboard space vehicles is limited. The number of everyday tasks and energy-intensive experiments on board space objects is growing with the development of astronautics. To perform energy-intensive work and experiments, energy consumption exceeds the incoming solar fluxes. The modern solar-hydrogen system ensures the reception, conversion and accumulation of excess incoming energy in the form of chemical energy hydrogen. Cryogenics makes it possible to miniaturize the solar-hydrogen system. The safety of the cryogenic solar-hydrogen energy system is ensured by hydrogen concentration and leakage sensors. The article proposes a comprehensive solution for miniaturization of Power Conversion Unit (PCU) of Energy Power System (EPS) of spacecrafts (SC), which consists in a joint solution of four key problems of miniaturization of power devices: energy, structural, design and technological, system. Miniaturization of the solar-hydrogen energy system (SHES) is achieved by installing onboard hydrogen and oxygen microcryogenic refrigerators, as well as hydrogen and oxygen cryogenic tanks, water tank, electrolyzer and hydrogen fuel cells (FC). The accumulation of chemical hydrogen energy on board the orbiting spacecraft ensures reliable operation when entering the shadow. Storage of hydrogen in cryogenic form significantly reduces the volume required. A cryocooler based on the Stirling cycle provides the process of liquefying hydrogen after the electrolysis of distilled water. In addition, cryogenic temperatures of 20.2 K can be used to thermostat precision instruments placed on board the spacecraft, For example, to ensure the operation of the SQUID. A 3D - model of a voltage stabilization module (VSM), on the basis of which EEC can be produced with different output power and redundancy depth. We give an example of a complete structural scheme of the EEC, which allows implementing all the fulfillment of all the tasks, assigned to the EEC of the PCU SC.

AB The present work presents a novel approach of employing two renewable energy sources for power and liquefied hydrogen cogeneration. Meanwhile, the main scheme comprises a biomass-fed (municipal solid waste) Brayton cycle using a digester, a geothermal-based flash binary cycle, and a Claude cycle for hydrogen liquefaction; the heat recovery is also performed through either an organic Rankine cycle (case A) or a Kalina cycle (case B) joint to the main scheme having two different configurations. Regarding the waste-to-energy framework designed for high performance, the system is comprehensively studied and optimized from the energy, exergy, and economic aspects. In this regard, thermodynamic-and economic-based sensitivity analysis, net present value method, and multi-objective grey wolf optimi-zation are implemented; the multi-criteria optimization is performed in three scenarios containing exergy efficiency-NPV, exergy efficiency-liquefied hydrogen's unit cost, and NPV-liquefied hydrogen cost. According to the results, the first scenario offers higher exergetic efficiency; the third scenario also provides a better hydrogen cost. As a result, the better optimum exergetic efficiency and liquefied hydrogen cost are equal to 10.95% and 3.84 $/kg for case A, and 10.38% and 3.74 $/kg for case B.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a sequentially coupling finite element analysis (PEA) program was utilized to simulate the welding temperature and predict the residual stress in the weld and Heat Affect Zone (HAZ) between the nozzle and the head. The results of a numerical calculation indicated that complex residual stresses were generated and concentrated in the weld and HAZ. Due to the existence of the interlayer gap between the two layers of the head, discontinuous stress distributions occurred. There were several sections where there are stress concentrations because of the discontinuous structure. The influences of welding heat input and preheating temperature were also investigated in this study. When the preheating temperature increased, the peak residual stresses in the structure decreased. The welding heat input had little effect on the residual stresses. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 2219 aluminum alloy has a series of advantages, such as good mechanical properties, stress corrosion resistance, welding performance, low hot crack tendency, and is widely used in the aerospace field. In the process of evaluating the welding process performance of 2219 aluminum alloy, it was found that the high porosity was proved to be the main weakness of the joint quality of AC TIG welding. The Straight Polarity Direct Current (DCSP) TIG welding process of 2219 aluminum alloy is realized by removing the oxide film on the surface of aluminum alloy with activating flux. The outstanding feature is that the internal porosity of TIG weld is effectively reduced, and the welding quality is improved. Therefore, the mechanism of activating flux to remove the internal porosity of 2219 aluminum alloy DCSP TIG welding was studied. The results show that DCSP TIG welding arc is stable, and the activating flux covers the weld pool surface, which can protect the weld pool and reduce the hydrogen solubility in the weld pool. The infrared thermal imager is used to measure the temperature of the welding joint. The coating of activating flux can increase the heat input of the DCSP TIG welding joint. The increase of the welding heat input reduces the solidification speed of the molten pool, increases the existence time of the molten pool, and hydrogen bubbles have enough time to escape from the molten pool. Through the analysis of the force on the surface of the molten pool, it can be seen that the coating of activating flux increases the heat input of the TIG welding joint. The greater the heat input, the stronger the effect of Lorentz force and plasma force on the molten pool, thus changing the movement direction of the metal in the molten pool, which is conducive to the bubble floating, and effectively inhibits the generation of weld porosity.

AB This paper describes a methodology for simulating the structural response of vented enclosures during hydrogen deflagrations. The paper also summarises experimental results for the structural response of 20-foot ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers in a series of vented hydrogen deflagration experiments. The study is part of the project Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations (HySEA). The project is funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 671461. The HySEA project focuses on vented hydrogen deflagrations in containers and smaller enclosures with internal congestion representative of industrial applications. The structural response modelling involves one-way coupling of pressure loads taken either directly from experiments or from simulations with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool FLACS to the non-linear finite element (FE) IMPETUS Afea Solver. The performance of the FE model is evaluated for a range of experiments from the HySEA project in both small-scale enclosures and 20-foot ISO containers. The paper investigates the sensitivity of results from the FE model to the specific properties of the geometry model. The performance of FLACS is evaluated for a selected set of experiments from the HySEA project. Furthermore, the paper discusses uncertainties associated with the combined modelling approach.

AB Hydrogen technologies have received increased attention in research and development to foster the shift towards carbon-neutral energy systems. Depending on the specific production techniques, transportation concepts, and application areas, hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) can be anything from part of the energy transition problem to part of the solution: Even more than battery-driven electric mobility, hydrogen is a polyvalent technology and can be used in very different contexts with specific positive or negative sustainability impacts. Thus, a detailed sustainability evaluation is crucial for decision making in the context of hydrogen technology and its diverse application fields. This article provides a comprehensive, structured literature review in the context of HSCs along the triple bottom line dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability, analyzing a total of 288 research papers. As a result, we identify research gaps mostly regarding social sustainability and the supply chain stages of hydrogen distribution and usage. We suggest further research to concentrate on these gaps, thus strengthening our understanding of comprehensive sustainability evaluations for HSCs, especially in social sustainability evaluation. In addition, we provide an additional approach for discussion by adding literature review results from neighboring fields, highlighting the joint challenges and insights regarding sustainability evaluation.

AB In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework for detailed kinetic mechanisms optimization applying the heuristic algorithm, namely canonic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The PSO is more effective and robust in coping with uncertainties and incomplete information than deterministic and probabilistic optimization algorithms and is more suitable for machine learning applications. In the proposed framework, to avoid trapping in a local minimum, 1000 local optimums have been obtained and statistically handled to select the final feasible model parameter set with reduced uncertainty intervals and parameter correlations. The developed framework was successfully used for the optimization of the joint H2 and syngas oxidation chemical kinetic model. The data set collected for the model optimization includes 41 reactions and 16 species, and 3000 experimental data targets supplied with uncertainty boundaries measured in shock tubes, jet stirred reactors, plug flow reactors, and premixed laminar flames under wide ranges of temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and H2/CO ratios. The initially estimated uncertainties of the reaction rate constants for 15 key reactions were significantly constrained. The reaction rate constants for the H2 oxidation sub-model were re-optimized and their uncertainties were further reduced.

AB This paper compares two approaches for predicting the consequences of vented hydrogen deflagrations: empirical engineering models (EMs) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The study is part of the project 'Improving hydrogen safety for energy applications through pre-normative research on vented deflagrations' (HySEA), funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) under grant agreement No 671461. The HySEA project focuses on vented hydrogen deflagrations in containers and smaller enclosures with internal congestion representative of industrial applications. Data from experiments conducted as part of the HySEA project are used to evaluate predictions from a selection of EMs and the CFD tool FLACS. The experiments involve various obstacle and venting configurations, and initially quiescent homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures with hydrogen concentrations in the range 15-24 vol%. There is a significant scatter in the maximum reduced overpressures predicted by the different EMs in the present study. For certain configurations, there is an order of magnitude difference between the different EM predictions. Two versions of the CFD tool FLAGS are used in the present study: i) the standard commercial release FLAGS v10.7r2, and an in-house development version termed FLAGS-beta. The commercial release generally over-predicts the maximum overpressures measured in the experiments, while the development version of FLAGS gives improved results for several configurations.

AB Joining materials with different physicochemical properties presents significant challenges. This study investigates the one-step anodization of aluminum in a mixed phosphoric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by the direct injection molding of polymer resin to enhance joint properties. The anodizing treatment is performed at constant electrical current with phosphoric acid solutions of various concentrations. Phosphoric acid anodizing enables the formation of 3D channeling pore structure with micropits and uniform nanopores on the aluminum surface. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidizing agent and promotes the dissolution reaction, thereby increasing the size of the nanopores. Larger pores facilitated the penetration of polymer resin into the aluminum oxide layer during injection molding, resulting in bonding strengths up to 40.34 MPa. This improvement is substantial when compared to the bonding strengths achieved through conventional injection molding processes. These results highlight that the increase in nanopore size due to hydrogen peroxide addition played a critical role in enhancing the bonding strength, as it facilitated better penetration and interlocking of the polymer resin within the anodized aluminum layer. Furthermore, a three-dimensional (3D) printing process was able to join polymer resins to the anodized aluminum surface, where the larger nanopores with the addition of the hydrogen peroxide is more beneficial to the bonding strengths than the direct injection molding is. This alternative approach addresses the environmental issues associated with the use of Cr(VI)-based anodizing solutions and the lightweight composites with applicability to various industries that could be produced using this method.

AB This paper gives an overview of the ongoing Joint Research Project (JRP) 20IND11 " Metrology infrastructure for high pressure gas and liquefied hydrogen flows " (MetHyInfra), which will ensure traceability in the hydrogen distribution chain. For this purpose, very precise nozzles with well-defined geometries have been produced. In this project, Critical Flow Venturi Nozzles (CFVNs) will be traceably calibrated for the first time with hydrogen and pressures up to 100 MPa using a Coriolis Flow Meter (CFM) as a secondary standard. A CFM has been successfully calibrated with hydrogen against a gravimetric primary standard. Equations of State (EoS) are important for the high-pressure calibration of the nozzles, but also for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. With regard to CFD, a numerical model has been developed to simulate high pressure hydrogen flow in the CFVN. In a parameter study, non -ideal nozzle shapes are investigated using a shape variation parameter. New Speed of Sound (SoS) measurements were conducted at temperatures from 273 to 323 K and pressures from 1 to 100 MPa. These new data were then used to develop a new EoS for normal hydrogen, optimized for gas phase calculations. In addition to gaseous hydrogen, the project has a strong focus on liquefied hydrogen. Here a three -pronged approach allows traceable measurements. Each of the approaches presented is based on a unique flow calibration principle and relies on independent traceability schemes. The results of the project will ensure traceable measurements and thus a higher level of confidence among end users.

AB Chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of late non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). There is no standard therapy for patients refractory or dependent to corticosteroid treatment. We hypothesized that hydrogen may exert therapeutic effects on cGVHD patients with few side effects. A prospective open-label phase 2 study of hydrogen was conducted. Patients received hydrogen-rich water 4ml/kg orally three times a day. Responses were graded in the skin, mouth, Gastrointestinal(GI), liver, eyes, lungs and joints and fascia every 3 months. A total of 24 patients (median age 27) were enrolled. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75%; 95% CI, 55.1% to 88%) had an objective response. No significant toxicity was observed. The estimated 4-year overall survival rate was 74.7%(95% CI, 54.9%-94.5%). The survival time was significantly prolonged in the response group. The survival rate at 4 years in the response group is significantly higher than the nonresponse group (86.6% vs 0%; p= 0.000132). Hydrogen showed great efficacy on cGVHD patients and long-term administration of hydrogen was not associated with significant toxic effects. The trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.Gov, NCT02918188.

DE Hydrogen deflagration; Pressurized release; Hydrogen stratification
AB University of Pisa performed hydrogen releases and deflagrations in a 1.14 m(3) test facility, which shape and dimensions resemble a gas cabinet. Tests were performed for the HySEA project, founded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking with the aim to conduct pre-normative research on vented deflagrations in enclosures and containers used for hydrogen energy applications. The test facility, named Small Scale Enclosure (SSE), has a vent area of 0,42 m(2) which can host different types of vent; plastic sheet and commercial vent were tested. Realistic levels of congestion are obtained placing a number of gas bottles inside the enclosure. Releases are performed from a buffer tank of a known volume filled with hydrogen at a pressure ranging between 15 and 60 bar. Two nozzles of different diameter and three different release directions were tested, being the nozzle placed at a height where in a real application a leak has the highest probability to occur. Three different ignition locations were investigated as well. This paper is aimed to summarize the main features of the experimental campaign as well as to present its results.

AB The first billion years of cosmic history remains largely unobserved. We demonstrate, using a novel machine learning technique, how combining upper limits on the spatial fluctuations in the 21-cm signal with observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen can impro v e our understanding of this epoch. By jointly analysing data from the Shaped Antenna measurement of the background RAdio Spectrum (SARAS3, redshift z approximate to 15-25) and limits from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA, z approximate to 8 and 10), we show that such a synergetic analysis provides tighter constraints on the astroph ysics of galaxies 200 million years after the big bang than can be achieved with the individual data sets. Although our constraints are weak, this is the first time data from a sky-averaged 21-cm experiment and power spectrum experiment have been analysed together. In synergy, the two experiments leave only 64 .9(-0.1)(+0.3 )per cent of the explored broad theoretical parameter space to be consistent with the joint data set, in comparison to 92.3(-0.1)(+0.3 )per cent for SARAS3 and 79.0(-0.2)(+0.5)per cent for HERA alone. We use the joint analysis to constrain star formation efficiency, minimum halo mass for star formation, X-ray luminosity of early emitters, and the radio luminosity of early galaxies. The joint analysis disfavours at 68 per cent confidence a combination of galaxies with X-ray emission that is less than or similar to 33 and radio emission that is greater than or similar to 32 times as efficient as present day galaxies. We disfa v our at 95 per cent confidence scenarios in which power spectra are >= 126 mK(2) at z = 25 and the sky-averaged signals are <=-277 mK.

AB The connection between Zr-2.5%Nb pressure tubes and modified martensitic stainless steel -403 end fittings in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) at the rolled joint is a critical site marked by enhanced hydrogen diffusion and elevated tensile residual stresses. The application of circumferential stress above a threshold leads to the formation of radial hydrides. Formation of radial hydride leads to a drastic reduction in fracture toughness and increase in Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) velocity. A comprehensive understanding of residual stress, hydride orientation and radial hydride fraction in this region is essential for the assessment of pressure tube structural integrity. In this study, we employ 3D nonlinear finite element analysis to estimate the residual stresses near rolled joints for both 220 MWe and 700 MWe pressure tubes. Additionally, we pioneer an experimental investigation into hydride orientation near roll joints through internal pressurization of hydrided pressure tube and end fitting assemblies. The study delves into the influence of residual stresses due to rolling process on hydride orientation and radial hydride fraction, providing crucial insights for the evaluation of the structural integrity of pressure tubes.

AB Aluminum samples have been exposed to a hydrogen plasma generated by a low-pressure - high-density microwave reactor. Aluminum has been chosen as a surrogate for Beryllium. The fluence was kept below 4 x 10(24) ions/m(2), in order to study the first steps of nucleation and growth of surface and bulk defects, i.e. blisters and bubbles. Experimental analyzes and macroscopic rate equation (MRE) modeling on poly- and single-crystals were made to investigate the role played by grains boundaries in the hydrogen retention. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Al poly-crystals revealed the production of aluminum hydrides (alanes) as majority species in the desorption flux. Comparison of microscopy observations for three different single-crystal orientations (< 100 >, < 110 > and < 111 >) allowed to determine preferential orientations able to attenuate the formation of blisters.

AB A sudden change in the geometrical parameters of a material, such as bends, T-branches, and welded joints may increase the stress concentration, which in turn may enhance the diffusible hydrogen concentration. In this study, quantitative evaluations of the effect of stress concentration factors on hydrogen environmental embrittlement (HEE) will be studied based on the mechanical performance of notched tensile specimens with variations in the stress concentration factors (K-t) of the X70 pipeline base and weld metal. To highlight the role of stress concentration, the tests are performed under a 10 MPa gas mixture condition with a low partial hydrogen pressure. The maximum strengths of the notched specimens were nearly consistent across all Kt values. The degree of HEE susceptibility of the base metal increased with increasing Kt value. However, in the weld metal, prominent reductions in the RA occurred at all Kt values. The complex HEE susceptibility of the weld metal can be attributed to the synergistic action of the microstructure heterogeneity and K-t values.

AB For the multi-layer and multi-pass welding process of the heavy plate, the hydrogen diffusion behavior was numerically simulated to study the effect of solid-state phase transition (SSPT) on the hydrogen diffusion in the thickness direction, and the influence of the residual stress-induced diffusion after SSPT. The calculation results were compared with the experimental results. The comparison shows that the distribution of hydrogen concentration in the direction of thickness was in good agreement. The position with the most severe cold cracking sensitivity was located at a 20-30 mm depth from the top surface in this article. After welding, the hydrogen concentration in this position was kept at a high level for a long time under the effect of the size-constraint effect of the heavy plate and the existence of welding residual stress gradient. In addition, the SSPT reduced the residual stress level of weld metal (WM) significantly, increased that of the heat affected zone (HAZ), and the hydrogen was redistributed under the influence of stress. In the process of phase transformation, the parameters of hydrogen diffusion property of the material changed dramatically in a short time, the hydrogen diffusion coefficient increased in order of magnitude, and the solubility decreased in order of magnitude. This directly led to the upward diffusion of hydrogen in WM, and produced a self-gathering effect. For a welded joint of heavy plate, the self-gathering effect between passes was effective in the short-range and ineffective in the long-range.

AB Neutron protein crystallography is a powerful tool for investigating protein chemistry because it directly locates hydrogen atom positions in a protein structure. The visibility of hydrogen and deuterium atoms arises from the strong interaction of neutrons with the nuclei of these isotopes. Positions can be unambiguously assigned from diffraction at resolutions typical of protein crystals. Neutrons have the additional benefit to structural biology of not inducing radiation damage in protein crystals. The same crystal could be measured multiple times for parametric studies. Here, we review the basic principles of neutron protein crystallography. The information that can be gained from a neutron structure is presented in balance with practical considerations. Methods to produce isotopically-substituted proteins and to grow large crystals are provided in the context of neutron structures reported in the literature. Available instruments for data collection and software for data processing and structure refinement are described along with technique-specific strategies including joint X-ray/neutron structure refinement. Examples are given to illustrate, ultimately, the unique scientific value of neutron protein crystal structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Concrete is widely utilized across various industries as a containment material. One essential property related to its performance is permeability, which determines its ability to allow the passage of gases or liquids through its pores and capillaries and even the transmission of aggressive agents. This study focused on investigating the permeability of gases with varying atomic weights and molecular volumes, such as helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, to pass through concrete. The primary objective was to determine the significance of variation in permeability and to evaluate and differentiate their behavior. To achieve this, concrete test specimens were employed, and factors such as cold joint impact, gas pressure, and specimen saturation levels were considered. Throughout the study, changes in weight, specimen humidity, resistivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity were monitored. The findings suggested that within concrete, the variation in permeability for these gases is negligible. By utilizing the acquired data, the present study estimated the permeability of hydrogen through mathematical models based on gas pressure and concrete thickness. These insights contribute to a deeper comprehension of concrete gas permeability and its potential impact on improving hydrogen containment.

AB The authors investigated the possibility of generation of hydrogen peroxide in seawater of various salinity under mechanochemical effects. Electrochemical methods determined inhomogeneities of the seawater structure. Proposed is possible mechanism of generation of H2O2 at multiple interfaces both in the complex electrolyte and in the presence of the suspension of minerals. At joint mechanochemical effect and UV radiation the prevailing contribution of the former is shown. The possibility of H2O2 generation in the seawater-air-mineral system at concentrations up to 5 x 10(-5) M contributes to produce technologies of mechanochemical purification of the seawater in coastal regions.

AB A novel approach is used for templateless synthesis of polypyrrole - gold nanocomposite material, taking advantage of polypyrrole nanoparticles synthesis method resulting in nanostructures of unblocked surface. Our approach leads to unsupported, nanocomposite system, where presence of gold nanostructures enables hydrogen ions reduction. Electrochemical methods: cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry or rotating disc electrode voltammetry allow to monitor the high rate of hydrogen ions transfer through the conductive polymer and their electrochemical reduction rate. These measurements confirm high active surface area of gold nanostructures immobilized in polypyrrole. On the other hand, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals pseudocapacitive properties of the material, typical for polypyrrole nanostructures. Thus, the obtained nanocomposite material shows joint and unhindered properties typical for gold nanoparticles and polypyrrole nanospheres. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing greenhouse gas emission strongly requires new efficient methods to close the carbon cycle. One promising strategy is to achieve reduction of CO2 and utilization of glycerol simultaneously in one-pot hydrothermal reaction. A possible mechanism through hydrogen-transfer reduction from glycerol was proposed by previous researchers. However, the detailed mechanism is still not clear, which prohibits the development of catalyst. In this study, by adopting a joint experimental and theoretical method, a kinetic model comprising reduction of CO2 and glycerol conversion is elucidated. The activation energy values are obtained in experimental and theory, respectively. The reduced species was found to be CO2 not bicarbonate based on the theoretical calculation.

TI Hydrogen Electrolysis in Refineries
SO OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Shell and ITM Power will build the world's largest hydrogen electrolysis plant at the Shell Rheinland Refinery in the Cologne area, Germany. With a peak capacity of 10 MW, the hydrogen will be used for the processing and upgrading of products at the refinery's Wesseling site as well as testing the technology and exploring applications in other sectors. The European partner consortium of Shell, ITM Power, SINTEF, thinkstep and Element Energy is supported by the European Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU). The project, named "REFHYNE", started in January 2018 and is scheduled to be in operation by 2020 after two years of design, permitting, construction and commissioning. It will be the first industrial scale test of the polymer electrolyte membrane technology process.
   This new unit at the Rheinland Refinery enables hydrogen to be made from electricity rather than from natural gas. A unit of this kind brings flexibility that can help stabilise the refinery power grid, thereby facilitating the use of renewable electricity. In addition, if powered by renewable electricity, the green hydrogen will help reduce the carbon intensity of the site and of the transport fuels produced in the refinery. Currently the Rheinland Refinery, Germany's largest refinery, processes approximately 180,000 t of hydrogen annually. The hydrogen is produced by steam reforming from natural gas. The 10 MW electrolyser will enable the production of an additional 1300 t of hydrogen per year, which can be fully integrated into the refinery processes, such as for the desulphurization of conventional fuels.
   Hydrogen has the potential to play an important role in the energy transition. Today, hydrogen is already being used in transport by fuel cell vehicles, as well as in industrial applications. When used in transport, hydrogen can also help improve local air quality, as the only emission of fuel cell vehicles is water vapor.

AB The authors have reported results of MgB2 test coils that exhibited anomalously low n-value. It was discovered that the major cause of the n-value related voltage was nonuniformity of the wire along its length. Based on this finding, the development of a compact 3 T magnet has been started. The magnet consists of six coils of 30 cm bore each. The fields will be 3 T at 4 K and 1.5 T at 20 K, respectively. The coils will be cooled by thermal conduction. One of the center coils was manufactured with the refined wire of improved lengthwise uniformity. Results of tests on this coil showed no measurable n-value related voltage. Superconducting joint development has been ongoing. Current peak multifilament joints show superconductivity up to 120 A at 14 K. Further trials to achieve the full short sample operating current at each temperature are ongoing. The cryogenic design for the magnet is based on the use of dual coolants either with hydrogen or helium and consists of two distinct and separate primary and secondary cooling circuits.

AB While it is widely recognized that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) promotes plant stress tolerance, the precise processes through which H2S modulates this process remains unclear. The processes by which H2S promotes phosphorus deficiency (PD) and salinity stress (SS) tolerance, simulated individually or together, were examined in this study. The adverse impacts on plant biomass, total chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence were more pronounced with joint occurrence of PD and SS than with individual application. Malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and electrolyte leakage (EL) levels in plant leaves were higher in plants exposed to joint stresses than in plants grown under an individual stress. When plants were exposed to a single stress as opposed to both stressors, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) treatment more efficiently decreased EL, MDA, and H2O2 concentrations. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were increased by SS alone or in conjunction with PD, whereas catalase activity decreased significantly. The favorable impact of NaHS on all the evaluated attributes was reversed by supplementation with 0.2 mM hypotaurine (HT), a H2S scavenger. Overall, the unfavorable effects caused to NaHS-supplied plants by a single stress were less severe compared with those caused by the combined administration of both stressors.

AB To provide new insight into the dark fermentation process, a multi-lateral study was performed to study the microbiology of 20 different lab-scale bioreactors operated in four different countries (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay). Samples (29) were collected from bioreactors with different configurations, operation conditions, and performances. The microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA genes 454 pyrosequencing. The results showed notably uneven communities with a high predominance of a particular genus. The phylum Firmicutes predominated in most of the samples, but the phyla Thermotogae or Proteobacteria dominated in a few samples. Genera from three physiological groups were detected: high-yield hydrogen producers (Clostridium, Kosmotoga, Enterobacter), fermenters with low-hydrogen yield (mostly from Veillonelaceae), and competitors (Lactobacillus). Inocula, reactor configurations, and substrates influence the microbial communities. This is the first joint effort that evaluates hydrogen-producing reactors and operational conditions from different countries and contributes to understand the dark fermentation process.

AB Three different macromolecular diols were synthesized by the reaction of Poly(1,4-butanediol adipate) diol (PBA) and diisocyanate (Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and Methylene-bis(4-cyclohexylisocyanate)(HMDI)) at the ratio of 2:1. Based on these macromolecular diols, waterborne polyurethane (WPU) adhesives were prepared. The structure and molecular weights of the WPU were characterized by Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding interaction of WPU were analyzed by the deconvolution FTIR spectra. The results showed that the hydrogen bonded NH was increased when carbamate was in the soft segment. The crystallinity of WPU was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the crystallinity of WPU2 (HDI) and WPU3 (HMDI) were enhanced, especially for WPU2. Meanwhile, the Tg,s as well as the mechanical strength, storage modulus, the contact angle and thermo-stability were increased with the introduced carbamate into soft segment. The T-peel tests of plasticized PVC/WPU/plasticized PVC joints and lap-shear tests of wood/WPU adhesive/wood joints were carried out. The results indicated that the carbamate in the soft segment could significantly enhance the adhesion of WPU at an appropriate activation temperature.

AB Herein, a novel W doped Co3S4 composite photocatalyst was successfully prepared by MOF (metal organic framework), Co-ZIF-9, as a nanoscaled template via a hydrothermal treatment. Efficient heteroatom doping emerged a large number of joints in Co3S4-WSX, providing multitudinous active sites for hydrogen catalysis. Moreover, due to these unmatched structural and compositional features, the optimized Co3S4-WSX hybrid without introducing any noble metal cocatalysts in the catalytic system also displayed a brilliant performance for hydrogen evolution and prominent stability under long-term visible light irradiation. In particular, the sample of Co3S4-WSX(0.6)), the amount of hydrogen evolution in the five-hour continuous light could reach up to 428.3 mol, which was increased by 38 times compared with Co-ZIF-9. In addition, some necessary characterization such as XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy, photoelectrochemistry and PL etc. were further examed to support related results and put forward the possible reaction mechanism.

AB Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common condition and leads to joint pain, disability, and price tag all over the world. Pathogenesis of OA is closely related to numerous inflammatory and apoptosis cytokines. Hydrogen (H-2) reportedly exhibits a diversity of effects such as anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties via the JNK pathway. However, it is unknown whether H-2 has a protective effect against OA via the JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this study was to figure out whether hydrogen has protective effect on chondrocyte and further explore the possible underlying mechanism.
   Methods: The chondrocytes were obtained from the human cartilage tissues. Cells were stimulated by TBHP and treated with hydrogen. In vitro treatment effects were evaluated by Western blot assay, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and TUNEL method. We conducted mice model of destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and treated with hydrogen. In vivo treatment effects were evaluated by X-ray imaging assay, safranin O (SO) staining, TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical assay.
   Results: Our results showed that hydrogen can inhibit inflammatory factors (ADAMTS5 and MMP13) and apoptosis factors (cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, and Bax) in TBHP-induced chondrocytes. Furthermore, hydrogen can suppress the activation of JNK signaling pathway, whereas the effect of hydrogen can be abolished by anisomycin (a JNK activator). In vivo results showed that hydrogen can down-regulate the expression of p-JNK and cleaved caspase-3 expression.
   Conclusion: We uncovered that hydrogen (H-2) could alleviate apoptosis response and ECM degradation in human chondrocytes via inhibiting the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, in the surgically-induced DMM mice model, treatment with hydrogen (H-2) performed a significant role in OA progression.

AB Optimizing oxygen levels in a sintering atmosphere seems to be a more economical method to realize die-attachment on a bare copper substrate with silver paste. In this article, the effects of oxygen content on the mechanical and thermal performance of sintered Ag joint on the bare copper substrate were investigated. The 5 x 10(3) ppm was demonstrated as the most appropriate oxygen content for the optimum bare copper joint, which removed most organics in the paste layer while preventing the copper substrate from oxidation. Besides, the bonding mechanism of joints sintered under different oxygen levels was clarified. For joint sintered at 1 x 10(3) ppm, excess residual organics significantly facilitated the formation of hydrogen bonds, resulting in the adhesive-dominated failure mode and worst overall performance. The increase of oxygen content to 5 x 10(3) ppm reinforced the bonding strength due to the Ag-Cu metallic bond formation at the interface and ameliorative densification of the sintered-Ag layer. As the amount of oxygen further increased, the copper substrate was oxidized, and bonding strength experienced a changing course of decline, rise, and flat, which can be attributed to Ag adhesion on the copper surface and the formation of voids at the interface between the oxide layer and copper substrate.

AB The power cycle reliability of Cu nanoparticle joints between Al2O3 heater chips and different heat sinks (Cu 40 wt.%Mo, Al-45 wt.%SiC and pure Cu) was studied to explore the effect of varying the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the heater chip and the heat sink from 4.9 to 10.3 ppm/K. These joints were prepared under a hydrogen atmosphere by thermal treatment at 250, 300 and 350 degrees C using a pressure of 1 MPa, and all remained intact after 3000 cycles of 65/200 degrees C and 65/250 degrees C when the CTE mismatch was less than 7.3 ppm/K, despite vertical cracks forming in the sintered Cu. When the CTE mismatch was 103 ppm/K, the Cu nanoparticle joint created at 300 degrees C endured the power cycle tests, but the joint created at 250 degrees C broke by lateral cracks in the sintered Cu after 1000 cycles of 65/200 degrees C. The Cu nanoparticle joint created at 350 degrees C also broke by vertical cracks in the heater chip after 1000 cycles of 65/250 degrees C, suggesting that although sintered Cu can be strengthened to tolerate the stress by increasing the joint temperature, this eventually causes the weak and brittle chip to fracture through accumulated stress. The calculation results of stresses on the heater chip showed that the stress can be higher than the strength of Al2O3 when the CTE mismatch is 103 ppm/K and the Young's modulus of the sintered Cu is higher than 20 GPa, suggesting that the heater chip can be broken.

ID IMPROVEMENT
AB Cryogenic containment systems for LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) generally require two barriers: the primary barrier made of stainless steel or Invar which contacts directly the cryogenic liquids, the secondary barrier made of composite or metal foil which functions as the faces of sandwich constructions for thermal insulation.
   The faces of sandwich constructions are bridged with metal strips which are usually adhesively bonded for gas tightness. When cryogenic liquids are loaded in the containment system, the adhesive bridge joints are subjected to both the thermal load and deformation due to the shrinkage of the sandwich constructions.
   Since the maximum deformation in the sandwich construction systems may occur in the metal bridge between the two sandwich constructions, the cryogenic performances of adhesive bridge joint with level difference, which would be generated due to manufacturing tolerance, were evaluated using both the new appropriate test method and FE analysis.

AB The crystal structure of the nickel battery positive electrode material, beta-NiOOH, is analyzed through a joint approach involving NMR and FTIR spectroscopies, powder neutron diffraction and DFT calculations. The obtained results confirm that structural changes occur during the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation leading to a metastable crystal structure with a TP2 host lattice. This structure involves two types of hydrogen atoms both forming primary and secondary hydrogen bonds. The formation of TP2 NiOOH as opposed to the more stable P3 host type during beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation has a kinetic origin that can be understood by a lower strain penalty involved in the transformation.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and substance P play a key role in inflammation. Using animal models of inflammation of different etiologies such as acute pancreatitis, sepsis, burns, and joint inflammation, studies have recently shown an important role of the proinflammatory action of H2S and substance P. Also, H2S contributes to inflammation in different conditions via substance P. This chapter reviews methods and key data that have led to our current understanding of the role of H2S and substance P in inflammation.

AB Underwater wet welding is widely used in offshore platform maintenance, oil pipeline repair and wreck salvage operations. A high diffusible hydrogen content is recognized as one of the critical reasons behind the reduction in the reliability of underwater wet welded joints. In this study, the entry route of hydrogen during underwater wet flux-cored arc welding of 304 stainless steel at a depth of 0.5 m was first con-firmed experimentally using an in-situ X-ray imaging system. The hydrogen charging was deemed to dominantly occur when pendant droplets were formed due to the extremely high temperature of molten metal and the absence of slag coverage. This resulted in 13.51 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen remaining in the droplet and 9.42 mL/100 g in the deposited metal. To prevent hydrogen charging, an unprece-dented molten-slag-covering droplet transfer mode was developed by reducing the CaF2 content and maintaining the CaF2/TiO2 to an appropriate ratio in the flux, through which the molten slag sponta-neously covered the droplet, electric arc and molten pool completely during the entire welding process and the entry of hydrogen was successfully blocked and the diffusible hydrogen content was reduced to the same level as that achieved via onshore welding (3.26 mL/100 g).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Ag-(0-8 mol%) CuO is used to successfully join aluminized ferritic stainless steel interconnect to the ceria-gadolinia (CGO) barrier layer of a solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell by reactive air brazing at 1000 degrees C in air. The wetting of Ag-CuO on CGO is tailored by varying the CuO content. The effects of the CuO content on the joint microstructure are discussed. The long-term stability of brazed joints is evaluated by aging in oxidizing (air) and reducing (4% H-2-50% H2O-N-2) atmospheres at 800 degrees C for 250 h. An Ag-2mol% CuO braze results in the best joint stability during aging. Aluminization of the steel to create an alumina surface layer provides excellent protection of the steel both during the joining process and aging in the 2 atm. No degradation related to steel corrosion and outward diffusion of elements from the steel can be observed. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Featured Application Modern robotic approaches to the evaluation of sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement and the degradation of steel and alloys by wear products.Abstract This paper briefly describes the conceptual direction of the application of computer vision (CV) methods that involve controlling the morphology of hydrogenated wear particles (WPs). During long-term operation, in the surface and subsurface layers of the materials of parts in the tribo-joint, changes in the micromechanisms of fracture occur, which change the morphology of WPs. It has been shown that the developed computer program (CP) can be used to monitor the fractography of the surface of wear particles, and, accordingly, it is possible to control changes in the surface morphology. Therefore, it is possible to predict the operational stability and durability of the tribo-joint. A conceptual scheme for determining the performance of a tribotechnical assembly depending on the determined parameters of WPs is presented. The modes marked on it, including normal operation, transient, run-in, and catastrophic failure, can be evaluated by robotics approaches.

AB Hyaluronic acid and phospholipids are two components in the synovial joint cavity that contribute to joint lubrication synergistically. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed and hydrogen bonds in hyaluronic acid were analyzed to identify specific sites that are responsible for its physical cross-linking. Two molecular masses of hyaluronic acid, 10 kDa and 160 kDa, were considered. We use molecular dynamics simulations and the small world network approach to investigate dynamic couplings using a distance map applied to oxygen atoms in a chain of hyaluronic acid in the presence of phospholipids and water. The distance characterizing the coupling can be defined in various ways to bring out the most evident differences between various scenarios of the polymer chain conformation We show herein a physical distance understood as H-bond length and classes of these distances which are defined in a coarse-grained picture of the molecule. Simulation results indicate that addition of phospholipids has little influence on hyaluronic acid crosslinking. However, longer chains and addition of lipids promote appreciably long lasting (resilient) networks that may be of importance in biological systems. Specific sites for hydrogen bonding of phospholipids to hyaluronic acid have also been identified.

AB In the present work, the failure investigation of a 30 in. diameter gas transmission pipeline (API 5L X-60 grade steel) has been described. The failure was due to a longitudinal crack developing in the centerline of longitudinal weld joint. Mechanisms and morphology of crack initiation and propagation were studied through different tests including: thickness measurement, chemical composition analysis, metallographic inspection, mechanical property testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The experiments resulted to the conclusion that some factors associated with Sulphide Stress Cracking (SSC) and metallurgical defects cause the failure of weld joint pipe. Detailed examination revealed that these factors are inappropriate welding parameters, pitting corrosion on longitudinal weld, and hydrogen permeation to the weld metal.

ID H2S
AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a physiological gaseous transmitter that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular redox state. Arthritis is usually accompanied by redness, swelling, pain, dysfunction and deformity of the joints, and in severe cases can lead to joint disability. Disorders of H2S level are associated with the pathological process of arthritis. In this paper, a near-infrared fluorescent probe (TX-H2S) was developed to detect the alterations in H2S levels of arthritis. TX-H2S has excellent response performance to H2S such as near-infrared emission (725 nm), large Stokes shift (125 nm) and high fluorescence enhancement (72-fold). Owing to low cytotoxicity, the probe can be employed to observe the alterations of exogenous and endogenous H2S level in HeLa and HepG2 cells. By making full use of near-infrared emission and good biocompatibility, the probe can be employed for exogenous H2S imaging in mice, and is able to track the fluctuation of H2S level during arthritis and its treatment. These make the probe have the potential to invent an efficient tool for the diagnosis of arthritic disease and its treatment.

AB As one of the main receptors of a second messenger, cGMP, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) isoforms I and II regulate distinct physiological processes. The design of isoform-specific activators is thus of great biomedical importance and requires detailed structural information about PKG isoforms bound with activators, including accurate positions of hydrogen atoms and a description of the hydrogen bonding and water architecture. Here, we determined a 2.2 angstrom room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of the human PKG II carboxyl cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB-B) domain bound with a potent PKG II activator, 8-pCPT-cGMP. The XN structure directly visualizes intermolecular interactions and reveals changes in hydrogen bonding patterns upon comparison to the X-ray structure determined at cryo-temperatures. Comparative analysis of the backbone hydrogen/deuterium exchange patterns in PKG II:8-pCPT-cGMP and previously reported PKG I beta:cGMP XN structures suggests that the ability of these agonists to activate PKG is related to how effectively they quench dynamics of the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and the surrounding regions.

AB In this study, Ultra-high Hard Armor (UHA) steel is welded with Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) steels using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process with Austenitic Stainless Steel (ASS), Duplex Stainless Steel (DSS), and Low Hydrogen Ferritic (LHF) fillers. Ballistic resistance against Weld Metal (WM) is determined using 7.62 x 39 mm BALL projectile. Three new modes of failure were identified from the ballistic testing (i) Finer Wear Debris with Cleavage (FWDC) (ii) Coarser Wear Debris with Cleavage (CWDC) (iii) Cleavage failure (C), based on the fractured surface. All joints stopped the ball projectile at the weld metal region without perforation. However, the joint fabricated using ASS electrodes shows superior ballistic performance than other joints with Cleavage mode of failure (C) mainly due to the absence of wear debris. ASS weldment (5% Delta ferrite and 95% austenite) performs better in ballistic resistance because of the plastic deformation along with energy absorption properties of the austenite phase than DSS (69 Delta ferrite and 31% austenite) and LHF (100% ferrite). Migration of Chromium (Cr) from the weld metal to base metal results in an unmixed zone and martensitic band in the HAZ of ASS joint.(c) 2022 CIRP.

AB As part of the analysis of the possibility of using the Ukrainian gas transportation system for transporting blends of natural gas and hydrogen, the peculiarities of the influence of hydrogen degradation of pipe steel on the brittle strength of girth welds and local corrosion metal losses were considered. For this, they were used the methods of finite-element modeling of the stress-strain state of structures during welding and subsequent operation loading along with advanced criteria of macroscopic fracture of a body with a crack. The results of predicting the safety factor for a typical welded part of a main gas pipeline with postulated surface cracks during the transportation of gas-hydrogen blends of various compositions showed that the most susceptible to brittle fracture are the weld metal and heat-affected zone. But with regard to the fatigue strength of welded joints under the action of cyclic loading by internal pressure or bending moment, larger stress intensity factor ranges in the heat-affected zone cause a more significant reduction of the residual safety factors. Local corrosion damage during the transportation of gas-hydrogen blends had a considerable negative impact on pipeline reliability, particularly when material properties experienced hydrogen degradation and a decrease in fracture toughness. However, this effect could be mitigated by adjusting the operating load accordingly.

AB The paper considers the integration and joint operation of a methane steam reforming unit (MSRU) and a heat pump unit (HPU) at a thermal power plant (TPP) as one of the possible ways to follow the global decarbonization policy. Research methods are simulation modeling of a thermal power plant in the program "United Cycle" and analysis of thermodynamic cycles of heat pumps. The Petrozavodskaya combined heat and power plant (CHPP) was selected as the object of the research. During the research, technological schemes for hydrogen production at the Petrozavodskaya CHPP were developed: with steam extraction to MSRU from a live steam collector and with the use of production steam. A scheme for HPU integration is proposed to reduce the cost of hydrogen and to reduce waste heat. A heat pump is used to preheat natural gas before going to MSRU. A method for determining fuel costs for hydrogen production in the trigeneration cycle of a thermal power plant was developed. The minimum specific fuel consumption for hydrogen production-7.854 t ref.f./t H-2-is achieved in the mode with steam extraction to MSRU from the turbine PT-60-130/13 (industrial extraction with a flow rate of 30 t/h). At this mode, the coefficient of fuel heat utilization is the highest among all modes with hydrogen production-66.18%.

AB The constantly increasing demand for renewable energy sources leads to the necessity of transporting large amounts of hydrogen. Since pipelines enable a cost-effective way for the distribution of gaseous hydrogen, the interaction of hydrogen and the pipeline materials must be carefully investigated as hydrogen can cause a degradation of the mechanical properties under certain conditions. Especially welds, which are assumed to be more susceptible to the degradation enhanced by hydrogen, are of great interest. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of gaseous hydrogen on the mechanical properties of an X65 pipeline, and the longitudinal submerged arc welding (SAW) welded joint. The tests are conducted using the hollow specimen technique on two types of specimens: one extracted from the base material (BM) and the other extracted as a cross-weld (CW) specimen consisting of BM and weld seam. The specimens are charged in situ under a pressure of 60 bar and tested using slow strain rate (SSR) tensile tests with a nominal strain rate of 10-5 s-1. The properties obtained of specimens tested in hydrogen atmosphere are compared to the properties of comparable specimen in inert argon atmosphere as a reference. The performed tests showed a decrease of the reduction of area (RA) from 72% in inert atmosphere to 52% in hydrogen atmosphere for the CW specimen and a decrease from 73% in inert atmosphere to 51% for the BM. Metallographic analyses showed the crack initiation between fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) and BM for the specimens tested in hydrogen atmosphere as well as for the reference specimens. This leads to the conclusion that the location of the crack initiation does not change due to the presence of gaseous hydrogen.

AB An approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to address the fuel cell thermal management system's circulating water pump and radiator control issue. The proposed joint control strategy consists of three main components. First, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based control framework is employed to overcome the strong coupling characteristics between the radiator and circulating water pump and enable joint control. Second, an improved method called TCO-DDPG is introduced to address time delay and inertia problems in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). This method adopts an improved updating delay strategy, optimized noise, and a classification experience playback and smooth target strategy to enhance algorithm robustness. Third, the TCO-DDPG-based PEMFC temperature control strategy replaces the traditional control framework's two independent controllers with an agent that does not depend on the system model and can control both the cooling water flow rate and the radiator fan speed.Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its ability to control the PEMFC thermal management system more precisely and effectively than other algorithms. Specifically, the proposed TCO-DDPG joint control technique reduces the average adjustment time by 7.6%, 16.01%, and 22.74%, and overshoot by 2.25 times, 4.2 times, and 4.5 times compared to the TD3, GA-PID, and PID algorithms, respectively.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB A metallic ceramic film consisting of nitrides, carbides and oxides of Ti, Cr and Al was prepared on the surface of a drilling pipe joint by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The adhesive ability and the corrosion resistance performance were evaluated by scratch test and corrosion test, respectively. The results show that the film is dense and homogeneous with 15 mu m in thickness including a 5 pm transition layer. The film presents a good adherence to the substrate with no cracks and no pores. It could decrease electrochemical corrosion and chemical corrosion through separating the harmful atoms or ions from the substrate. Particularly, it could also effectively prevent H2S and CO2 from contacting the steel, avoiding hydrogen blistering (FIB) and hydrogen to induce cracking (HIC). Consequently, the service life of drilling pipe can be greatly improved.

AB The goal of the EU Horizon 2020 RISE project 778307 "Hydrogen fuelled utility vehicles and their support systems utilising metal hydrides" (HYDRIDE4MOBILITY), is in addressing critical issues towards a commercial implementation of hydrogen powered forklifts using metal hydride (MH) based hydrogen storage and PEM fuel cells, together with the systems for their refuelling at industrial customers facilities. For these applications, high specific weight of the metallic hydrides has an added value, as it allows counterbalancing of a vehicle with no extra cost. Improving the rates of H-2 charge/discharge in MH on the materials and system level, simplification of the design and reducing the system cost, together with improvement of the efficiency of system "MH store-FC", is in the focus of this work as a joint effort of consortium uniting academic teams and industrial partners from two EU and associated countries Member States (Norway, Germany, Croatia), and two partner countries (South Africa and Indonesia).
   The work within the project is focused on the validation of various efficient and cost-competitive solutions including (i) advanced MH materials for hydrogen storage and compression, (ii) advanced MH containers characterised by improved charge-discharge dynamic performance and ability to be mass produced, (iii) integrated hydrogen storage and compression/refuelling systems which are developed and tested together with PEM fuel cells during the collaborative efforts of the consortium.
   This article gives an overview of HYDRIDE4MOBILITY project focused on the results generated during its first phase (2017-2019). (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB This paper studies the corrosion fatigue crack growth (CFCG) in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution of the local zones of A7N01S-T5 aluminum alloy metal inert gas (MIG) welded joints cut from high-speed train underframes after service lives of 1.8 million km. The results show that the base metal (BM) region exhibits the highest rate of CFCG compared to both the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and the weld metal (WM) zone. Crack features suggest that the corrosion fatigue failure mode of the BM is hydrogen-assisted propagation and that the failure mode for both the HAZ and WM is anodic dissolution. We calculate that the multi-site adsorption and substitution of Cl- on the surface of the passivation film can make the oxygen and aluminum atoms detach from the surface of the passivation film, causing its destruction and allowing the cracks to expand further. Hydrogen is more likely to accumulate and diffuse along the grain boundaries, reducing their strength and causing them to become the most likely orientation for crack propagation. This study provides the new insight into the specific CFCG mechanisms of each zone in aluminum alloy welded joints.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In underwater wet welding, a hydrogen-rich arc atmosphere generated by the thermal decomposition of water leads to extremely high diffusible hydrogen content and defects such as pores and cracks in the weld. In the present study, a neutral slag system was designed and verified for its protection in underwater wet flux-cored arc welding. This neutral slag system forms a stable protective layer of molten salt on the surface of the molten pool, mechanically isolating the molten metal from the water environment and effectively delaying heat loss. More crucially, it also retained the chemical metallurgical dehydrogenation component. When pure Ni belt was used as the outer metal, weld joints free of porosity were obtained, and the diffusible hydrogen content of the deposited metal was 3.61 mL/100 g, close to the level of onshore welding. This neutral slag system was further extended to the use of a pure Fe belt, where the diffused hydrogen content of the molten metal was 10.40 mL/100 g.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB The goal of this paper was determining the physical and chemical properties of some medicinal plants which are used against the Covid19 symptoms. In this work, seven medicinal species for the most frequently symptoms of Covid19 disease such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, anorexia, muscle-joint pain, headache and Nausea-vomiting based on the fidelity level index has been accomplished.
   Positive stranded RNA viruses, coronaviruses (CoVs), can infect humans and multiple species of animals through enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system diseases with attractive targets for designing anti- Covid19 conjunction. In this work, it has been investigated the compounds of kaempferol, quercetin, demethoxycurcumine, naringenin, apigenine-7-glucoside, oleuropein and catechin as a probable anti pandemic Covid19 receptor derived from medicinal plants.
   Anti-Covid19 through the hydrogen bonding using the physicochemical properties including heat of formation, Gibbs free energy, electronic energy, charge distribution of active parts in the hydrogen bonding, NMR estimation of medicinal ingredients jointed to the database amino acids fragment of Tyr-Met-His as the selective zone of the Covid19, positive frequency and intensity of different normal modes of these structures have been evaluated. The theoretical calculations were done at various levels of theory to gain the more accurate equilibrium geometrical results, and IR spectral data for each of the complex proposed drugs of N-terminal or O-terminal auto-cleavage substrate were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of seven medicinal plants jointed to active site of Covid19 molecule. A comparison of these structures with two configurations provides new insights for the design of substrate-based anti-targeting Covid19. This indicates a feasible model for designing wide-spectrum of anti- Covid19 drugs. The structure-based optimization of these structures has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N and O atoms through forming the hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) with potent anti- Covid19.
   Finally, two medicinal ingredients of apigenine-7-glucoside and demethoxycurcumine jointed to TMH have directed to a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The results strongly suggest that the different data observed in the apigenine-7-glucoside and demethoxycurcumine in the solvent is principally due to basis set functions, induced by a change in polarity of the environment. It is clear that an increase in the dielectric constants enhances the stability of these anti-Covid19 drugs.

AB With increasing performance demands and the growing dimensions of structures, the challenges for fastening technology in steel construction are also rising. To ensure a secure and long-lasting connection of individual components, high-strength bolted joints of property class 10.9 are essential. They play a key role in structural integrity and operational safety. The reliable performance of these connections is crucial to preventing accidents, unplanned downtimes, and high repair costs. At the same time, the use of high-strength fasteners of property class 10.9 increases the risk of hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (H-SCC). The combination of a susceptible material condition, mechanical stress, and hydrogen availability can, under certain conditions, lead to delayed fractures without warning. This article presents four case studies of failures in high-strength bolted connections and analyzes key factors influencing their susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. It becomes evident that damage can occur even when applicable standards are met. This is due to various factors, including unfavorable material conditions, manufacturing influences, corrosion protection application, and assembly processes. The study highlights that many of these failures could be prevented through targeted material selection, optimized manufacturing processes, and stringent process control.

AB In this work, three ultrasonic radiators in different shapes have been designed in order to investigate the effects of radiator shapes on the argon bubble dispersion and diving as well as the degassing efficiency on magnesium melt. The radiator shape has a strong influence on the bubble diving and dispersion by ultrasound. A massive argon bubble slowly flows out from the radiator with the hemispherical cap, due to the covering hemispherical cap. Using a concave radiator can intensively crush the argon bubbles and drive them much deep into the water/melt, depending on the competition between the argon flow and opposite joint shear force from the concave surface. The evolution of wall bubbles involves the ultrasonic cavities carrying dissolved gas, migrating to the vessel wall, and escaping from the liquid. Hydrogen removal can be efficiently achieved using a concave radiator. The hydrogen content can be reduced from 22.3 mu/g down to 8.7 mu g/g. Mechanical properties are significantly promoted, due to the structure refinement and efficient hydrogen removal.

AB This paper summarises the results from a blind-prediction benchmark study for models used for estimating the consequences of vented hydrogen deflagrations, as well as for users of such models. The work was part of the HySEA project that received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) under grant agreement no. 671461. The first blind-prediction benchmark exercise in the HySEA project focused on vented explosions with homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures in 20-foot ISO containers. The scenarios selected for the second blind-prediction study focused on vented deflagrations in inhomogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures resulting from continuous stratification of hydrogen during vertical jet releases inside 20-foot ISO containers. The deflagrations were vented through commercial vent panels located on the roof of the containers.
   The test program included two configurations and four experiments, i.e. two repeated tests for each scenario. The paper compares experimental results and model predictions and discusses the implications of the findings for safety related to hydrogen applications. Several modellers predicted the stratification of hydrogen inside the container during the release phase with reasonable accuracy. However, there is significant spread in the model predictions, especially for the maximum reduced explosion pressure, and including predictions from different modellers using the same model system. The results from the blind-prediction benchmark studies performed as part of the HySEA project constitute a strong incentive for developers of consequence models to improve their models, implement automated procedures for scenario definition and grid generation, and update training and guidelines for users of the models.

AB A joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the valence-shell excitations of hydrogen deuteride has been performed by the fast electron impact method at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV and the multireference single- and double-excitation configuration-interaction method. Momentum-transfer-dependent inelastic squared form factors for the vibronic states belonging to the B-1 Sigma(+)(u), C-1 Pi(u), and EF1 Sigma(+)(g) of molecular hydrogen deuteride have been derived with a high-energy resolution of 70 meV. Similar to the results of molecular hydrogen [L. Q. Xu, K. Xu, Y. G. Peng, X. Xu, Y. W. Liu, Y. Wu, K. Yang, N. Hiraoka, K. D. Tsuei, J. G. Wang, and L. F. Zhu, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032503 (2018)1, the present calculations do not satisfactorily reproduce the profiles of the inelastic squared form factors for the higher vibronic states of the B-1 Sigma(+)(u) of hydrogen deuteride. However, the discrepancies between the experimental and calculated results of the B-1 Sigma(+)(u) of hydrogen deuteride show a weaker dependence on the vibronic number than those of molecular hydrogen, i.e., the present experimental results for the B-1 Sigma(+)(u)of hydrogen deuteride are in better agreement with the calculated ones than those of the molecular hydrogen. It is very likely that the electronic-vibrational coupling effect in hydrogen deuteride is less important than that in molecular hydrogen. For the C-1 Pi(u) state and some vibronic excitations of the EF1 Sigma(+)(g) state, the present experimental results are lower than the present calculations, which may be due to the fact that the first Born approximation does not hold at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV.

AB As an ideal antioxidant and anti-apoptotic substance, hydrogen (H-2) has protective effects on many isolated organs, such as the heart, lung and kidney. In this study, we explore whether H-2 improves the preservation effect of osteochondral allograft by adding it to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) solution during the tissue culture stage. The osteochondral allograft apparatus was used to harvest 60 pieces of cylindrical allografts (l=10mm, d=6mm) cartilage in the lateral loading area of the femoral condyle from the pig knee joint in the aseptic condition, and the grafts were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control group (DMEM solution without hydrogen); H-1 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.2mmol/L); H-2 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.4mmol/L); and H-3 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.8mmol/L). The chondrocyte viability, histological changes (hematoxylin and eosin staining, Safranine O staining, and collagen type II immunohistochemistry staining) and biomechanical properties (Young's modulus) of the osteochondral allograft were investigated after 28days' storage. The chondrocyte viability and proteoglycan and collagen type II contents in the H-3 and H-2 groups were higher than that in the Control and H-1 groups, and the H-3 group had the highest values. However, significant differences were not observed between the four groups based on Young's modulus. Hydrogen as an additive to the DMEM solution improved the preservation effect of osteochondral allograft. The preservation effect of hydrogen occurred in a concentration-dependent manner.

AB This paper investigates the hydrogen diffusion process in X80 steel under the coupling condition of a symmetric tensile and compressive stress fields. The stress gradient introduced through a four-point-bending inflict a stress-induction effect on hydrogen diffusion. When the direction of stress gradient is the same as that of hydrogen's diffusion, it promotes the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. Conversely, it would inhibit the diffusion process of hydrogen atoms. In addition, deformation can also affect the intrinsic hydrogen diffusion coefficient of X80 steel by changing the density of dislocation traps inside the sample. As long as the dislocation density N-T(sigma) in the loaded sample decreases by no more than 5% compared to that N-T(0) in original sample, the experimentally measured value of intrinsic hydrogen diffusion coefficient of X80 steel can be achieved. The decrease in dislocation density was verified through an in-situ EBSD test under various uniaxial tensile stress. The joint function of above two mechanisms resulted in an increase in apparent hydrogen diffusion coefficient as the degree of deformation increases. However, the change is more significant when hydrogen diffuses along the direction of partial derivative sigma(h)/partial derivative x>0. Meanwhile, an increase in strain energy caused by the deformation and the reconstruction of dislocations can affect the anodic dissolution process of X80 steel through mechanochemical effects and local-additional-potential effects, respectively. The two compete with each other, causing the anodic dissolution current of X80 steel to show a trend of first increase and then decrease with raised deformation degree on both the tensile and compressive stress sides, which coincide well with the dislocation reconstruction phenomenon within the current deformation range.

AB Arthroplasty brings the wear problems because of body fluid has poor performance as lubricant. Lubricant which is used in artificial joints will rapidly degrade and be absorbed by human body after injecting. To prolong the lubricant's effectiveness, this study prepared chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) (CS/PEG) and textures to play a role in joint lubrication and wear protection. Chitosan (CS) and poly(ethylene glycol) which have biocompatibility and biodegradability properties can be used in human body. The tribological results shown that CS/PEG sol has excellent performance when this sol was composed by 2 wt% CS and 30 wt% PEG, the average friction coefficient below 0.016 under the condition of 30-90 N load (pressure 4.2-12.6 MPa). In this study, CS/PEG was added in the texture of artificial joints, then the surfaces of the CS/PEG formed gel via NaOH solidification effect. The CS/PEG gel film could prevent the CS/PEG sol from diluting in body fluid. Meanwhile, FT-IR, XRD, UV/vis and Raman spectra revealed that CS associated with PEG via hydrogen bond effect may form a particular structure, which leaded the good tribological performance. This study provides a new, simple and green approach to enhance tribological performances of artificial joints. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In pursuit of the "double carbon" objectives, converting high-carbon thermal power plants into carbon capture power plants is recognized as an effective measure to mitigate carbon emissions. In order to improve the economy of the system, an electric hydrogen generation unit is introduced, and an economic dispatch strategy that considers the combination of a flexible carbon capture power plant and electric hydrogen generation is proposed. Firstly, the low-carbon principle of the flexible carbon capture plant is introduced, and secondly, the joint operation structure of the flexible carbon capture plant, pumped storage, and hydrogen generation is constructed in order to fully exploit the synergistic operation potential of the hydrogen and carbon capture plants. On this basis, an economic dispatch model with the objective of the lowest combined system cost of the sum of system operation cost, system carbon trading cost, hydrogen production revenue, and wind and light abandonment cost is established, fuzzy parameters are used to characterize the uncertainty levels of wind and light, fuzzy opportunity constraints are established, and the model is solved using an improved sparrow search algorithm. The results of the example show that the proposed model reduces the comprehensive cost by 20.9% and carbon emissions by 61.77% compared with the existing model, which has significant low-carbon economic benefits.

AB The complementary operation of hydropower, photovoltaic, and wind power can promote the integration of renewable energy resources into the grid. However, the competition of power transmission channels among multiple energy raises surpluses significantly. This study equips a hydrogen production plant for the hydro-wind-PV hybrid system to utilize the power surplus. First, a multi-scale nested joint operation model that considers both long-term and short-term operation strategies is proposed to simulate the operation process of the hybrid system. Then, the potential surplus of the system is evaluated and used as the power source of the hydrogen production plant. Lastly, the optimal hydrogen production plant size is determined based on economic and technical analysis. A case study is performed with the Yalong River basin of China. The results show that (McElroy and Chen, 2017 (1)) The deployment of a 260 MW hydrogen production system has the potential to boost the annual power generation benefit of the hybrid system by 610 million CNY; (2) The fluctuation of hydropower station output is effectively reduced, subsequently mitigating operational risks. Especially during flood season, the power variation coefficient experiences a notable decrease of approximately 75%; Liu and Xu (2022) (3) The deployment of hydrogen production plants is more economically feasible than expanding power transmission channels, particularly when considering long-distance power transmission. Furthermore, given that hydrogen production plants frequently operate under fluctuating power conditions, the electrolyzers and compressors must exhibit prompt responsiveness to these power variations.

AB To meet the growing demand for lightweight structures in the aerospace industry, laser welding of dissimilar high-strength aluminum alloys has emerged as a key manufacturing technology. However, the incorporation of filler materials during laser welding significantly influences porosity formation and microstructural evolution, thereby affecting the mechanical properties of the welded joints. Unlike previous studies that have focused on a single filler material, this study systematically investigates, for the first time, the effects of three distinct types of filler materials (atomized powders of AlCu5, AlSi12, and AlMg5) on the macroscopic morphology, microstructure, and mechanical properties of laser-welded joints between dissimilar AA2195 and AA7075 aluminum alloys. The study results demonstrate that, in comparison with the other two filler materials, the grains in the AlSi12-welded joint were significantly refined in both the weld zone (WZ) and the partially melted zone (PMZ), with grain sizes reduced to 31.2 mu m and 15.9 mu m, respectively. The addition of Si reduces the thermal conductivity of the molten pool, thereby slowing the solidification rate and promoting the escape of hydrogen bubbles, resulting in an internal porosity as low as 1.07% in the joint. Moreover, the AlSi12 welded joint exhibited the highest proportion of high-angle grain boundaries in the PMZ, reaching 91.51%. In addition, the interaction between the second phase and dislocations significantly impeded dislocation motion. Owing to the synergistic effects of multiple mechanisms, the resistance to crack initiation and propagation in the AlSi12 welded joint was significantly improved, with the fracture location shifting from the conventional PMZ to the WZ, and the ultimate tensile strength reached 285 MPa.

AB Rigid closed-cell foam is widely used to thermally insulate liquid hydrogen and oxygen tanks of space launch vehicles due to its lightweight, mechanical strength and thermal-insulating performance. Up to now, little information is available on the intrusion of moisture into the foam that subjects one side to liquid hydrogen temperatures and the other side to room temperatures and high relative humidity. A novel cryogenic moisture uptake apparatus has been designed and fabricated to measure the moisture uptake into the polyurethane foam. For safety and convenience, two identical single-stage pulse tube cryocoolers instead of liquid hydrogen are used to cool one side of the foam specimen to the lowest temperature of 26 K. Total of eight specimens in three groups, according to whether there is a butt-joint or weathering period, are tested respectively for both 5 h and 9 h. The additional weight due to moisture uptake of the foam for the 26 K cases is compared to previous measurements at 79 K. The results are instructive for the applications of foam to the insulation of liquid hydrogen tanks in space launch vehicles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The membranes of vanadium alloys can be substantially more productive and much cheaper than the palladium alloy membranes which are widely used for hydrogen separation. However, the insufficient workability of vanadium alloys makes difficult producing the membranes of any shape, except for small thick flat samples, suitable only for laboratory studies, while membranes in the form of thin-walled tubes are most preferable for practical use. Such seamless thin-walled self-maintained membranes of tubular shape, made of V-Pd and V-Fe alloys with a thin Pd-coating on their inner and outer sides and with welded joints to stainless steel on both ends, were fabricated and tested for their throughput, service life, mechanical stability, and capability of hydrogen recovering from WGS mixtures. In view of reliable and highly productive operation of tubular V-alloy membranes as well as of their absolute selectiveness, the assembly from 18 membranes was fabricated to use it in the multi-fuel processor feeding a 1 kW PEM FC and providing up to 16 slpm of ultrapure hydrogen by the steam conversion of light and heavy hydrocarbons including diesel "Euro 5". A similar assembly made of V-Fe alloy membranes was estimated for hydrogen purification in MOCVD applications. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the further deterioration of environment and the depletion of fossil fuels, the alternative energy sources are urgently needed to be discovered. Hydrogen holds great promise thanks to its unlimited resources, high energy density and the environmentally friendly nature. However, its low volume density under normal temperature and pressure becomes the main challenge for on-board storage. Owing to its high potential of safety, one of the optimal solution for the future hydrogen vehicle is storing hydrogen using metal hydride (MH) under proper temperature and pressure. This work focuses on the state of charge (SOC) estimation of the embedded MH hydrogen storage tank. High precise estimating of the remaining energy will contribute to both the evaluation of reliability and the design of control strategy. A statistical model of SOC is proposed based on the database collected form laboratory experiments and real operation vehicle test. What's more, a joint multi classifier is designed to recognize the current state of reaction. Under this condition, the SOC of MH hydrogen storage tank is calculated through combining the state classifier and SOC model. This proposed on-line SOC estimation procedure is validated with the real operation vehicles in both charging and discharging process. It is proved to be effective with the estimation error of 0.2% during charging and 4.29% of discharging.

AB The 5000 series non-heat-treatable Al -Mg alloys are widely used as structural members, because of excellent combination of weldability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. It is well known that these alloys can become susceptible to inter-granular stress corrosion cracking. In the previous paper, the authors revealed that hydrogen embrittlement (HE) takes place in weld corner (fusion zone adjacent to HAZ) in an MIG-welded joint of 5083 alloy. In this study, the base material and MIG-welded joint of the 5083 alloy were sensitized, and their resistance to HE was investigated by two methods: humid gas stress corrosion cracking (HG-SCC) and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests. The results obtained were discussed, in comparison with the previous results obtained in the non-sensitized joint. Discussion was also made in terms of the difference of the two testing methods. Extension of HG-SCC cracks were observed for all sensitized 5083 alloy samples, base and welded samples tested in humid air, and hence HE was confirmed. Fractography and surface observation on the crack tip of HG-SCC revealed that the crack propagates in a transgranular manner. The extent of HG-SCC was greater in the present sensitized specimens in all the locations except the weld corner, but the position dependency has been the same: crack propagation amount was largest in the weld corner. On the other hand, SSRT test results did not indicate any reduction in ductility or strength when testing environment was changed from dry nitrogen gas to humid air. Therefore, it is concluded that HG-SCC test is more sensitive for detecting HE of 5083 alloy

ID AROMATIC-SUBSTITUTION
AB It has been found that 1-dialkylamino-8-(pyrrolyl-1)-naphthalenes 1 and 6, upon treatment with an equimolar amount of HBF4 under ambient conditions, produce 1-dialkylammonium salts which are transformed into 7,7-dialkyl-7H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]perimidine-7-ium tetrafluoroborates 5 and 7, respectively. The reaction proceeds in a highly selective manner and represents the first case of nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen in the initially inactivated pyrrole ring. The scope and limitations of the transformation, apparently operating due to the joint action of the "proximity effect" and proton catalysis, are outlined.

AB The use of friction stir welding (FSW) has proven to be an excellent alternative to join engineering components. Although FSW has had a significant development in recent years, challenges for new applications have been raised, such as offshore steel parts suffering hydrogen embrittlement in the gas and oil industry. Therefore, in this work, the microstructure, corrosion, and hydrogen-induced cracking were investigated in a two-pass FSW welded joint of API 5L X70 pipeline steel. The electrochemical results indicate an inhibitory effect on corrosion reaction because of a carbonate product generation in the steel surface. The polygonal ferritic and degenerated pearlite bands microstructure in the base metal fixed carbonate deposits in the steel surface. In the welded regions, the bainitic microstructure and the carbide particle distribution are less efficient in setting the weld surface carbonate deposit. HIC tests showed cracks initiation and propagation to be more prone in hard phases. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The disinfection efficiencies of a commercial mixture of peracetic acid against Escherichia coli were studied in laboratory scale experiments. The joint and separate action of two disinfectant agents, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, were evaluated in order to observe synergistic effects. A kinetic model for each component of the mixture and for the commercial mixture was proposed. Through simple mathematical equations, the model describes different stages of attack by disinfectants during the inactivation process. Based on the experiments and the kinetic parameters obtained, it could be established that the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide was much lower than that of peracetic acid alone. However, the contribution of hydrogen peroxide was very important in the commercial mixture. It should be noted that this improvement occurred only after peracetic acid had initiated the attack on the cell. This synergistic effect was successfully explained by the proposed scheme and was verified by experimental results. Besides providing a clearer mechanistic understanding of water disinfection, such models may improve our ability to design reactors.

AB A framework is planned to supply electrical and thermal loads by joint application of a hydrogen storage system (HSS) and a fuel cell. The system, including electrical and thermal loads, is connected to the upstream network. The bidirectional operation is defined for the system, and the system can buy energy from the grid or sell energy to the grid. A water electrolyzer is applied to produce hydrogen from water and store electricity in the form of hydrogen. The stored hydrogen supplies the thermal loads, as well as the fuel cell. The electrical loads are directly connected to the grid and are supplied by the grid. The electricity is received from the fuel cell at hours 17 to 22. When the price of electricity is high, the electrical loads can receive their power from the fuel cell rather than the grid. Additionally, any excess electricity may be sold to the grid. The uncertainty in the thermal and electrical loads is modeled and formulated as stochastic programming. The hydrogen is fed to the fuel cell and the thermal loads. The proposed model minimizes the daily operational cost of the system. The results demonstrate that the daily operational cost of the system is $22.274 USD/day. The bidirectional operation reduces the daily operational cost by about 79%. The unceratinty increases the cost by about 15%.

AB Using high energy density welding arc, the joining processmakes pipe joints involvingmelting of base metal. The thermal cycle could cause distortion and have residual stress around joints and there could be a prospect of hydrogen cracking. By employing proper heat treatment procedures, the physical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of steel structures are regained for their long endurance under extreme operating conditions of pressure and temperature, particularly, in power industries. The joints need to undergo pre- and post-weld heat treatment. Induction heating is increasingly being used for heat treatment of pipes, tubes, pressure vessels, etc., made up of a special type of steel such as P91 Grade. As the popularity of the heat treatment process is on the rise, it is important to look into the energy efficiency and power delivery aspects of the system. This paper proposes an innovative method to configure the induction heating controller and the tank circuit so that the energy delivery to the pipe and its usage are inherently improved. The proposed ideas have been practically demonstrated using a 40-45 kW induction heater.

AB The increasing packaging density and power density have led to a drastic increase in the electric field strength between solder joints, and the accelerated movement of ions significantly rises the potential for failure of solder joints caused by electrochemical migration (ECM). To improve the anti-electrochemical migration ability of Sn3Ag0.5Cu solder (SAC305), we doped Cu6Sn5 nanoparticles (NPs) into SAC305 solder paste and studied its mechanism for inhibiting ECM. In this experiment, Cu6Sn5 NPs were prepared by ultrasound-assisted chemical reduction, and composite solder pastes were prepared by mechanically mixing Cu6Sn5 NPs with SAC305. In situ observation of the ECM between electrodes was carried out under different operating conditions. The addition of Cu6Sn5 NPs within 0.6 wt% could effectively inhibit the ECM by prolonging the incubation period. However, when the amount of Cu6Sn5 NPs exceeded 0.6 wt%, the catalytic effect of Cu6Sn5 NPs on the hydrogen evolution reaction would create vigorous convection within the droplet, which accelerated the failure by ECM. Apart from that, it was found that the addition of Cu6Sn5 NPs could increase the threshold for instantaneous failure of solder joints under high voltage.

TI Hydrogen atom scattering at the Al2O3(0001)

SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Investigating atom-surface interactions is the key to an in-depth understanding of chemical processes at interfaces, which are of central importance in many fields - from heterogeneous catalysis to corrosion. In this work, we present a joint experimental and theoretical effort to gain insights into the atomistic details of hydrogen atom scattering at the alpha-Al2O3(0001) surface. Surprisingly, this system has been hardly studied to date, although hydrogen atoms as well as alpha-Al2O3 are omnipresent in catalysis as reactive species and support oxide, respectively. We address this system by performing hydrogen atom beam scattering experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a high-dimensional machine learning potential trained to density functional theory data. Using this combination of methods we are able to probe the properties of the multidimensional potential energy surface governing the scattering process. Specifically, we compare the angular distribution and the kinetic energy loss of the scattered atoms obtained in experiment with a large number of MD trajectories, which, moreover, allow to identify the underlying impact sites at the surface.

AB In the study of hydrogen bonds between noncoordinated and metal-coordinated ethylenediamine and a water molecule, the data in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) were analyzed and DFT calculations were performed. For coordinated ethylenediamine in the CSD, the analyzed distributions of d(OH) distances show a maximum in the range of 2.0-2.1 angstrom, while the angle alpha shows a maximum in the range of 150-160 degrees. The DFT calculations were done for octahedral geometries of cobalt(III), copper(II), and nickel(II) complexes and square-planar geometry of palladium(II) complexes. The coordination of ethylenediamine to the metal ions strengthens its hydrogen bond with the water molecule. Namely, noncoordinated ethylenediamine and the water molecule have an interaction energy of -2.3 kcal/mol, while for coordinated ethylenediamine, the interacting energy spans from -4.0 to -28.0 kcal/mol depending on the metal ion and charge of the complex. The hydrogen bond energies have a good correlation with the calculated electrostatic potential on the interacting hydrogen atom. The coordination number and oxidation states of the metal have a significant influence on the electrostatic potential on the interacting hydrogen atom and the energy of hydrogen bonds.

AB Pressureless sintering of nanosilver paste has been widely demonstrated for bonding power semiconductor devices on silver-or gold-coated substrates. In this paper, we extended the application of nanosilver bonding to bare copper surface by controlling sintering atmosphere in an effort to prevent surface oxidation of copper during sintering. Three different atmospheres were evaluated: 1) pure nitrogen (N-2); 2) nitrogen with 1 vol% oxygen (1% O-2/N-2); and 3) a forming gas consisting of 4 vol% hydrogen and 96 vol% nitrogen (4% H-2/N-2). The bonding strengths of sintered joints were evaluated by dieshear test. The joints sintered in 1% O-2/N-2 had the lowest average bonding strength of approximately 15 MPa due to the formation of copper oxide clearly visible on the failure surface of the substrate. The joints sintered in 4% H-2/N-2 had the highest average bonding strength of over 40 MPa. Microstructure characterization of the sintered joints showed that the bond-line density was strongly affected by the sintering atmosphere. The joints sintered in the forming gas had a denser microstructure than those sintered in pure nitrogen. It is believed that the higher sintered density is a result of catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of organic binder in the paste, which occurred at the sintering temperature with nanoparticles of silver as catalyst. This increase in microstructure density and prevention of copper surface oxidation led to the high bonding strength of the sintered joints formed on copper in the forming gas.

AB Hydrogen assisted fracture near welds is the result of a combination of microstructural changes and the accumulation of hydrogen. With the aim of predicting local hydrogen concentrations, hydrogen redistribution near a crack tip is simulated using a Boundary Layer approach and diffusion modelling is modified by trapping phenomena. The simulated non-homogeneous geometry includes layers that reproduce weld metal, heat affected zones and base metal of a 2.25Cr-1Mo steel; mechanical and diffusion properties have been extracted from references. The hydrogen transport model here considered involves a stress dependency that affects local concentrations; thus, the possible interaction between constraint effects associated to a graded material with hydrogen entry and transport is studied. Results show that the constraint effect is not significative for the loading and for the widths assigned to the weld and the heat affected zones (2.5 to 5 mm); however, for the HAZ-centred crack, a higher hydrostatic peak and the corresponding increase in lattice hydrogen are found. A two-type trapping process is also simulated to reproduce simultaneously the effect of dislocation trapping and micro-structure delayed diffusion. Hydrogen is weakly trapped in dislocations and it is added to the lattice concentration to obtain a measure of diffusible hydrogen near a crack tip while effective diffusivity is strongly reduced by deeply trapped hydrogen. Differences between environmental or internal hydrogen sources are expected to be more accurately captured because stress-dependent boundary conditions have been implemented for hydrogen uptake.

ID SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PREDICTION; MG(BH4)(2)
AB Mg(BH4)(2) is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, releasing 14.9 wt% hydrogen upon conversion to MgB2. Although several dehydrogenation pathways have been proposed, the hydrogenation process is less well understood. Here, we present a joint experimental-theoretical study that elucidates the key atomistic mechanisms associated with the initial stages of hydrogen uptake within MgB2. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray absorption, and X-ray emission spectroscopies are integrated with spectroscopic simulations to show that hydrogenation can initially proceed via direct conversion of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)(2) complexes. The associated energy landscape is mapped by combining ab initio calculations with barriers extracted from the experimental uptake curves, from which a kinetic model is constructed. The results from the kinetic model suggest that initial hydrogenation takes place via a multi-step process: molecular H-2 dissociation, likely at Mg-terminated MgB2 surfaces, is followed by migration of atomic hydrogen to defective boron sites, where the formation of stable B-H bonds ultimately leads to the direct creation of Mg(BH4)(2) complexes without persistent BxHy intermediates. Implications for understanding the chemical, structural, and electronic changes upon hydrogenation of MgB2 are discussed.

AB The artificial joints would go through serious wear after implantation surgery due to the poor lubrication of the body fluid, and the biomimetic lubricants directly injected in vitro is easy to be absorbed by human tissues, and after a period of time, it will lose its lubrication effect. However, the composite hydrogel with slow-release lubrication effect provides a new way for the lubrication of artificial joints. In this study, Graphene oxide/Poly (ethylene glycol) (GO/PEG) composites were prepared to improve the artificial joint lubrication, and through wrapped in the Chitosan/Sodium glycerophosphate (CS/GP) hydrogel, the GO/PEG lubricant will be released under the squeezing action, thus to prolong the service time of biomimetic lubricants. The friction experimental results showed that GO/PEG had better lubrication effect, and the average friction coefficient of the slow-release solution was below 0.03, especially with the pressure increasing. GO, PEG and small molecule GP in the slow release solution through hydrogen-bond interaction might form a particular structure, which led to the good lubricating effect. The experiments of cell and acute toxicity in vivo showed that GO and its composite hydrogel had good biocompatibility.

AB Silver-copper oxide reactive air brazes are the most widely used Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) brazes. However, the conventional Ag-4 wt.% Cu composition has a high wetting angle of similar to 40 degrees in air on yttriastabilized-zirconia (YSZ) that leads to manufacturing defects (denoted as Type I pores). Also, many elements that oxidize during brazing to promote braze wetting (such as Cu) are easily reduced by SOFC fuels. This results in Type II pores that decrease the braze interfacial strength and provide a quick path for hydrogen permeation into the braze (where the hydrogen reacts with diffused oxygen to form gaseous water pockets, denoted as Type Ill pores). The present work demonstrates that transient porous nickel interlayers, instead of reactive element additions, can be used to promote Ag wetting on YSZ and produce high-quality YSZ-stainless steel braze joints. Mechanical tests on these reactive-element-free, silver based SOFC braze joints, both before and after 500 h of 750 degrees C oxidation in air, show that the braze and braze interface strengths are higher than the underlying YSZ|NiO-YSZ substrate. The elimination of Type I and Type II porosity enabled by this new technique should result in improved braze lifetimes for SOFC and other ceramic-to-metal sealing applications.

AB As a new zero-carbon energy with high calorific value, hydrogen has attracted extensive attention in recent years. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified molybdenum sulfide and molybdenum oxide heterostructure (MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3) was obtained via a simple hydrothermal method. The low band gap of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 (1.15 eV) endowed a good near-infrared (NIR) light response. The conduction band position of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 (-0.63 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) was negative enough to produce hydrogen. Compared with pure MoS2, the formation of MoS2-MoO3 heterostructure and introduction of MWCNTs generated better photoelectrochemical activity and NIR irradiation improved photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) hydrogen evolution performance in wide pH range. The 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 had superior overpotential (68 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)) in acidic media. The NIR improved PEC hydrogen evolution activity of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 in acidic media could be ex-plained by Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The presence of large amount of bridging S-2(2-) in 1 T/2 H phase MoS2 and the synergistic effect between MWCNTs and MoS2-MoO3 heterostructure made a joint effect on the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). NIR irradiation could increase the charge transport rate. The introduction of MWCNTs and heterostructure formation could increase the charge transport rate and improve the electron and hole separation ability of 0.02MWCNTs-MoS2-MoO3 as well.

AB Since the fluctuation and uneven distribution of solar energy seriously restrict its integration in the power mix, it is of great significance to promote cross -regional solar energy consumption. Herein, an innovative route of largescale solar energy utilization is proposed, including full-spectrum solar hydrogen production and hybrid pipeline transport. Based on the spectral beam splitter, full-spectrum solar energy is efficiently converted into hydrogen through methanol steam reforming and water electrolysis. Then, the produced hydrogen is transported to the energy intensive areas by an existing natural gas pipeline to minimize the capital investment. A joint model of proposed system is established using AspenPlus/Matlab, and the thermodynamic and economic performances are investigated comprehensively. Results show that the proposed system demonstrates the highest energy and exergy efficiencies, reaching 32.35 % and 28.54 % respectively. Among all the cases, the dynamic payback period is the shortest at 6.92 years, as well as the net present value is highest at 3087.63 million US$ in the proposed system, followed by the case of trucking + shipping, and trucking + natural gas pipeline. Summarily, the proposed system allows better utilization of available solar energy without significant infrastructure investments, which highlights the strong potential of cross -regional utilization and production of renewable hydrogen.

AB Gas Tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process was employed for welding of Inconel 718 with two different shielding gases, namely argon (Ar) and argon with a 5 vol% hydrogen mixture (ArH) and two fillers viz., ERNiCrMo-10 and ERNiCrMo-4. The effects of gas composition and filler wires on the laves phase formation were studied in detail. The results revealed that hydrogen addition through ArH shielding gas mixture resulted in better grain refinement in the welds than pure Ar. The hydrogen addition induced a steep thermal gradient in the weld, which lowered the segregation of elements like Niobium (Nb) and Molybdenum (Mo) at the interdendritic regions. The laves phase formation in Mo-rich filler addition welds was minimized due to restriction of Nb segregation by Mo at the interdendritic region. Tensile test results indicated that the strength and ductility of the joints of both autogenous and filler added welds of Ar were higher than the ArH shielded welds. In the case of filler added welds, higher Mo content filler exhibited better tensile properties in both shielding gas combinations due to solid solution strengthening of Mo. Nano-sized hydrogen assisted cracks observed in ArH autogenous welds caused a reduction of strength and ductility.

AB The new generation pillow plate heat exchanger (PPHX) is a type of PHXs with a complex wavy structure with desirable thermal-hydraulic characteristics. For the main structure of PPHX, edge welding joints are usually a common and economical design. However, the stress concentration and presence of corrosive media often lead to premature failure of welding structure. In this study, the leakage failure of PHX after 80,000 hours of service was evaluated. The crack at the edge joints of corrugated 316L steel plates was detected by dye permeability detection. The failure of welding joints was studied by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope(SEM), EBSD and X-ray diffraction(XRD). The corrosion product was observed only at inside of the edge joints. The mud pattern morphology and EDS analysis of high Cl ion concentration(2.87 wt.%) on fracture surface revealed the stress corrosion cracking mechanism. Chloride and hydrogen ions were enriched as an occluded cell mechanism on the narrow gap between plates. The carbide precipitated on the grain boundary of the HAZ during the welding process, which initiates cracking under the crevice corrosion environment. Based on the studies carried out, a structure modification welding without narrow gap, duplex or ferrite stainless steel replace the 316L stainless steel, periodic inspection and strict deionization of cooling water were suggested to eliminate such failures.

TI Determining predictive metabolomic biomarkers of meniscal injury in dogs

SO JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE

DT Article
AB Objectives: This study used hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the first time to examine differences in the metabolomic profile of stifle joint synovial fluid from dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture with and without meniscal injuries, in order to identify biomarkers of meniscal injury. Identifying a biomarker of meniscal injury could then ultimately be used to design a minimally invasive diagnostic test for meniscal injuries in dogs. Materials and Methods: Stifle joint synovial fluid was collected from dogs undergoing stifle joint surgery or arthrocentesis for lameness investigations. We used multi-variate statistical analysis using principal component analysis and univariate statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance and analysis of co-variance to identify differences in the metabolomic profile between dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture and meniscal injury, cranial cruciate ligament rupture without meniscal injury, and neither cranial cruciate ligament rupture nor meniscal injury, taking into consideration clinical variables. Results: A total of 154 samples of canine synovial fluid were included in the study. Sixty-four metabolites were annotated to the hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra. Six spectral regions were found to be significantly altered (false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.05) between groups with cranial cruciate ligament rupture with and without meniscal injury, including three attributed to nuclear magnetic resonance mobile lipids [mobile lipid -CH3 (P=0.016), mobile lipid -n(CH3)3 (P=0.017), mobile unsaturated lipid (P=0.031)]. Clinical Significance: We identified an increase in nuclear magnetic resonance mobile lipids in the synovial fluid of dogs with meniscal injury which are of interest as potential biomarkers of meniscal injury.

AB A seamless pipe made of AISI 321 stainless steel represented a part of a transportation pipeline system for hydrogen-containing hot gas in a hydrocarbon cracking unit. After a service period of approximately 21 months, a segment of such pipe demonstrated the cracks, causing leakage and respective fire. For clarification of a failure root cause, various metallurgical investigations combined with numerical simulations have been applied. The results revealed that the rupture of seamless pipe was evidently influenced by hydrogen assisted cracking (HAC). An increased susceptibility of the alloy to HAC had to be attributed to its sensitive microstructure which was related to the occurrence of slip bands with a high quantity in austenite grains, particularly in the specific region underneath the outer wall surface. In addition, the intensity of restraint resulting from the T-joint weld configuration caused respectively higher triaxial stresses in the confined area on the outer wall surface where the crack started. The numerical simulations of hydrogen diffusion revealed that a uniform hydrogen concentration profile over the pipe wall thickness was reached when the service period was more than 20 months. This duration agreed well to the time-to-failure of the actual component. Considering additionally that the final stage of rupture by overload was preceded by severe HAC, as confirmed by the respective intergranular fracture topography.

AB In this study, the weldability of high-hardness armor steel by the gas metal arc welding method has been investigated. The study was aimed at determining the weakness points of manual welding compared to automated welding through microhardness testing, the cooling rate, tensile characteristics and nondestructive analysis. Detailed studies were performed for automated welding on the impact energy and microhardness in the fusion line, as the most sensitive zone of the armor steel weld joint. It was demonstrated that the selection of the preheating and interpass temperature is important in terms of the cooling rate and quantity of diffusible and retained hydrogen in the weld joint. The tensile strength was higher than 800 MPa. The width of the heat-affected zone did not exceed 15.9 mm, measured from the weld centerline, while the impact energy results were 74 and 39 J at 20 and - 40 A degrees C, respectively.

AB The present study investigated the impact on a CRDI engine of adding hydrogen and synthetic antioxidant tertbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in waste cooking biodiesel under varying load conditions. Concentrations of 1000-2500 ppm of antioxidant TBHQ were added to the evaluated fuels using ultra-sonication. Hydrogen injection is kept at a constant flow rate of 10L/min. XRD analysis is used to determine the antioxidant's crystalline structure. Results revealed that adding TBHQ in the B20 sample (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel) has lowered the BSFC and increased the BTE, but there has been an increase in emissions such as smoke, CO, and HC. Antioxidant TBHQ at a concentration of 2000 ppm has been observed to attain the highest oxidation stability and also lower the maximum NOx emission. However, a decline has been observed in in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and heat release rate (HRR). In comparison with diesel, the joint effect of hydrogen and TBHQ has improved the BTE by 7.39% for the blend B20 + 2000 ppm + H2, and BSFC decreased by 11%. Hydrogen enrichment and higher antioxidant content in B20 have reduced the emissions of NOx by 3.63% than diesel. The blend B20 + 1000 ppm + H2 shows a 1.93% higher peak pressure than diesel. Thus, hydrogen-enriched and antioxidant-added biodiesel might be considered a fossil fuel substitute and benefit diesel engine performance.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB In general, the ultrasonic techniques have been used to determine the mechanical properties of materials based on their relationship with metallurgical characteristics. In this research work, the relationship between ultrasonic wave velocity, hardness and the microstructure of steel pipeline welded joints is investigated. Measurements of ultrasonic wave velocity were made as a function of the location across the weld. Hardness measurements were performed in an attempt to correlate with ultrasonic response. In addition, the coarse and dendritic grain structure of the weld material is extreme and unpredictably anisotropic. Thus, due to the acoustic anisotropy of the crystal, weld material of studied joints is anisotropic too. Such structure is no longer direction-independent to the ultrasonic wave propagation; therefore, the ultrasonic beam deflects and redirects and the wave front becomes distorted. Thus, the use of conventional ultrasonic testing techniques using fixed beam angles is very limited and the application of conventional ultrasonic phased array techniques becomes desirable. This technique is proposed to assist pipeline operators in estimating the hardness through ultrasonic measures to evaluate the susceptibility to stress sulphide cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking due to hard spots in steel pipeline welded joints in service. Sound wave velocity and hardness measurements have been carried out on a steel welded joint. For each section of the welding, weld bead, fusion zone, heat affected zone and base metal were found to correspond particular values of the ultrasound velocity. These results were correlated with electron microscopy observations of the microstructure and sectorial scan view of welded joints by ultrasonic phased array.

AB The effects of thermal exposure at 600 degrees C and subsequent electrolytic hydrogen charging at ambient temperature were studied in terms of their influence on notch-tensile properties and fracture behaviour of individual heat-affected zones (HAZ) of Ni-based transition weldments between T24 and T92 creep-resistant steels. The experimental welded joints were prepared by gas tungsten arc welding using "Inconel-type" filler metal Nirod 600. Post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) was carried out at 720 degrees C for 2 h, followed by passive cooling within tempering furnace. Subsequent long-term ageing of two series of prepared T24/T92 dissimilar welds at 600 degrees C for 1000 and 5000 h, respectively, led to gradual changes in both T24 and T92 HAZ microstructures, which were mainly related to their additional tempering accompanied by the coarsening of original precipitates as well as newly-formed secondary phases. The observed thermally-induced microstructural changes together with subsequently applied hydrogen charging effects resulted in complex variations in tensile properties and fracture behaviour of individual HAZ regions related to the pre-existing differences in their initial tempering grade due to the used PWHT procedure.

AB This study reports a novel integrated system for power generation with on-site produced hydrogen and heat recovery. The main equipment of the integrated system includes a steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production, a palladium membrane (Pd-M) unit for hydrogen purification, a waste heat collector (HC) unit for heat recovery, and a low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC) for power generation. ASPEN Plus and MATLAB/Simulink jointed simulation model is used to establish an accurate model for the whole integrated system. Moreover, for the SMR reactor, it is found that the RPlug reactor simulation module is more appropriate compared with the RGibb module. Then a detailed parametric analysis is carried out to estimate the effects of hydrogen utilization, the SMR reactor operating temperature, and the current density of the PEMFC stack on the overall energy and exergy efficiency of the integrated system. Finally, thermodynamic analysis is performed on the integrated system with S/C of 3.0, SMR reaction temperature of 700 degrees C, PEMFC hydrogen utilization rate of 0.8, and power generation of 520 W, delivering energy and exergy efficiencies as high as 47.4% and 45.7% under these operating parameters. The thermodynamic analysis shows that the PEMFC stack is the primary source of the system exergy destruction (326.27 W) with 34.33% of the relative exergy destruction ratio.

It is found that the samples are capable of the dissociative absorption of water from the gas phase, and energetically nonequivalent OH- groups are the only form of oxygen-hydrogen groups. It is shown that the joint iso- and heterovalent doping of cationic sublattices with BaLaInO4 substantially raises the concentration of protons in the structure of hydrated samples, which could help in achieving proton transfer

TI A comprehensive analysis on the longitudinal fracture in the tool joints

ID FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB The Longitudinal fractures or splits in tool joint box of drill pipe often occur, because the numbers of deep, directional, extended and horizontal oil wells are increasing. The mechanism of frictional heat check cracking of drill pipe tool joints was discussed in the standard API RP 7G. However, authors have identified that heat check cracking was just one of the cracking initiation mechanism, not crack propagation mechanism. This paper has reviewed 21 cases of this kind of failure analyzed by authors from year 2000 to 2015. Fracture surfaces and mechanical properties have been examined in this paper. It was found that there were various other causes of crack initiation, in addition to frictional heat check cracking, such as tong tooth bite marks and friction damage in internal threads. Such cracks propagated mostly via stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism, although two cases was brittle cracking due to poor material toughness. The stress corrosion mechanism was related to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or ionic sulfur (S2-), which came from the degradation of applied thread greases or drilling fluid ingredients. Although heat check cracks and tooth bite marks as crack initiation are common-place, the failure can be prevented through prevention of crack propagation. Failure data showed that although improved transverse material absorbed energy avoided longitudinal brittle cracking of the tool joint, stress corrosion cracking still occurred. The statistical analysis results showed that material hardness was related to the longitudinal cracking of drill pipe tool joints. It was demonstrated that if material hardness was restricted to less than HB310, the crack did not propagate. It was suggested that the material hardness of tool joints box should be revised to HB285-HB310, in addition that the transverse material Charpy absorbed energy of the tool joint should be specified.

AB We show that by jointly fitting cosmic microwave background (CMB) and astrophysical data-a compilation of UV luminosity data from the Hubble Frontier Field and neutral hydrogen data from distant source-we can infer on the shape of the evolution of the ionized hydrogen fraction with redshift, in addition to constraining the average optical depth tau. For this purpose, we introduce here a novel extended model that includes hydrogen ionization histories which are monotonic with redshift, but allow for an asymmetry, as indicated from our previous works on a free-form reconstruction of reionization. By using than the one inferred by Planck 2018 data because of the combination of CMB with astrophysical data. We find that the symmetric hypothesis within our parametrization is disfavored at 4 sigma. We test our findings by using alternative likelihoods for CMB polarization at low multipoles, i.e. based on the 2020 reprocessing of Planck high frequency instrument data or on the joint analysis of Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and Planck low frequency instrument data, obtaining consistent results that disfavor the symmetric hypothesis of the reionization history at a high statistically significant level. These results will be further tested by more precise astrophysical data such as that from JWST and Euclid deep fields.

AB Mass spectrometry with hydrogen-radical-mediated fragmentation techniques has been used for the sequencing of proteins/peptides. The two methods, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization in-source decay (MALDI-ISD) and hydrogen attachment/abstraction dissociation (HAD) are known as hydrogen-radical-mediated fragmentation techniques. MALDI-ISD occurs during laser induced desorption processes, whereas HAD utilizes the association of hydrogen with peptide ions in the gas phase. In this study, the general mechanisms of MALDI-ISD and HAD of peptides were investigated. We demonstrated the fragmentation of four model peptides and investigated the fragment formation pathways using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The current experimental and computational joint study indicated that MALDI-ISD and HAD produce aminoketyl radical intermediates, which immediately undergo radical-induced cleavage at the N-C-alpha bond located on the C-terminal side of the radical site, leading to the c'/z(center dot) fragment pair. In the case of MALDI-ISD, the z(center dot) fragments undergo a subsequent reaction with the matrix to give z' and matrix adducts of the z fragments. In contrast, the c' and z(center dot) fragments react with hydrogen atoms during the HAD processes, and various fragment species, such as c(center dot), c', z(center dot) and z', were observed in the HAD-MS/MS mass spectra.

AB Nondestructive testing is an integral part of quality assurance for critical products. The complex structure of metal-polymer hydrogen cylinders complicates the reliable detection of defects using a single type of flaw detection. In this regard, the application of combined nondestructive testing is of interest. This study examines the joint use of ultrasonic and thermal flaw detection with the synthesis of their results. Experimental verification demonstrated that the developed methodology for synthesizing ultrasonic and thermal testing data improved defect detectability compared to the separate use of these nondestructive testing methods.

AB IR spectroscopy, X-ray phase analysis, and high-resolution electron microscopy were used to examine the nature of the interaction of organic acids with silicates in their joint mechanical activation for the example of succinic acid. It was found that mechanocomposites with chemically bound components are formed in the course of activation of acid-layered silicate mixtures. It was shown that in the acid/nano-SiO2 composite, monomer molecules of the acid are bound to nano-SiO2 via molecules of adsorbed water, which form rather strong hydrogen bonds with the basic active centers of nano-SiO2 and hydroxy groups of the monomer molecules of the acid.

AB Nucleic acids can fold into well-defined 3D structures that help determine their function. Knowing precise nucleic acid structures can also be used for the design of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. However, locations of hydrogen atoms, which are key players of nucleic acid function, are normally not determined with X-ray crystallography. Accurate determination of hydrogen atom positions can provide indispensable information on protonation states, hydrogen bonding, and water architecture in nucleic acids. Here, we used neutron crystallography in combination with X-ray diffraction to obtain joint X-ray/neutron structures at both room and cryo temperatures of a self-complementary A-DNA oligonucleotide d[GTGG(C-se)CAC](2) containing 2'-SeCH3 modification on Cyt5 (C-se) at pH 5.6. We directly observed protonation of a backbone phosphate oxygen of Ade7 at room temperature. The proton is replaced with hydrated Mg2+ upon cooling the crystal to 100 K, indicating that metal binding is favored at low temperature, whereas proton binding is dominant at room temperature.

AB Cold metal transfer (CMT) welding of AlSi7Mg alloy sheets prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) was employed using ER4047 and ER5356 filler wire. Effect of the filler wires on hydrogen pores, microstructures and mechanical properties of welded joints was studied. As a result, CMT welding of AlSi7Mg alloy sheets using ER5356 wire reduces the porosity, refines the grains, increases the fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), modifies the eutectic Si-rich morphology, and improves the solid solution strengthening of Si elements in the alpha-Al matrix of the microstructures in the weld metal (WM). Additionally, the morphology of eutectic Si-rich phases in heat affected zone (HAZ) of the welded joint is noticeably changed from the continuous cellular networks in base metal (BM) to totally globularized particles, as a result of the increased welding heat effect with decreasing distance to the WM. Compared with the ER4047 wire, the welded joint with ER5356 wire achieves higher WM hardness and higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS), which have been increased by 13.9 % and 18.6 %, respectively. The enhanced mechanical properties of the welded joints with ER5356 wire are mainly attributed to the reduced porosity and the improved microstructures in the WM.

AB Underwater welding is widely used for maintenance and repairs of underwater structures such as undersea pipes, offshore structures and nuclear power plants. In practice, underwater welding has the disadvantage related to high cooling rate and unstable welding arc due to the water hydrostatic pressure. This affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of underwater welded joints. Many of previous research works on underwater welding have been carried out only on a laboratory scale in shallow water depth, whereas underwater welding was used to weld in the depth of the water with a metre scale. Undersea structures experience fatigue load due to the fluctuation force of water flow. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of water depth on the fatigue life of underwater welded joints. Low carbon steel SS400 specimens were welded underwater with depths of 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m. The air welded joint was also evaluated for comparison purposes. Fatigue life was evaluated according to the ASTM E466 standard by using a rotary bending machine. Furthermore, tensile test, micro hardness measurement and microstructure evaluation were also conducted for gathering supporting data. The fatigue and tensile strength of the air welded joints were higher than those of the underwater welded joints. The porosities caused by the dissolved hydrogen gas, carbon (monoxide and dioxide) gases and water vapor in weld metal of the underwater welded joints decreased the fatigue and tensile strength. An interesting phenomenon on the underwater welded joints was that the deeper the water level, the higher became the fatigue, tensile strength as well as hardness. Based on the microstructure analysis, the number of acicular ferrite structures in weld metal increased as the water level depth increased.

TI Characteristics of Welding Residual Stress Distribution in Dissimilar

DE cryogenic steel; welding residual stress; dissimilar joint; analytical
   method; LNG storage tank
AB For the construction of ecofriendly ships, fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), ammonia, and hydrogen are being discussed as alternatives. LNG fuel has recently been applied to shipbuilding. The most important aspect of an LNG propulsion ship is the LNG storage tank, because LNG is stored at a high pressure and low temperature. Cryogenic steels are needed to evaluate safety in weld joints, especially the LNG storage tank which has a dissimilar weld joint with a STS pipe. The dissimilar weld joint has a complex welding residual stress distribution. It is necessary to evaluate the effects of temperature changes that occur during the loading-unloading process of LNG. In this study, the residual stress distribution characteristics of heterogeneous welding parts welded to STS pipes using 9% Ni steel, STS, and high-manganese austenitic steel in an LNG storage tank were investigated through experimental and analytical methods. The thermal stress due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between cryogenic steel and the STS pipe occurred with a small amount in loading-unloading of LNG. When high-manganese austenitic steels and the STS pipe were joined, tensile stress was generated at the dissimilar weld joint owing to the temperature difference generated during the LNG loading-unloading process. STS has a homogenous weld joint and identical thermal expansion coefficients; therefore, the shrinkage and expansion were not affected by the temperature change. The welding residual stress at the dissimilar weld joints was measured via an experimental cutting method, and the results indicated that the tensile residual stress had distribution similar to the yield stress of the material. The stress generated by the temperature change and the welding residual stress overlapped and occurred during the loading-unloading process of the LNG tank; however, the final tensile stress below the tensile stress was distributed in the storage tank.

AB Welding at low atmospheric temperatures is frequently needed for the construction of steel structures in cold regions. In this work, the Charpy impact test in parallel with metallurgical observation was carried out to evaluate the low temperature impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints constructed at low ambient temperatures. The impact fracture energy at low temperatures of structural steel joints welded at room temperature was also investigated for comparison. Standard V-notch Charpy impact specimens were prepared and tested under dynamic loading condition. The effects of low climatic temperatures during welding on the low temperature impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints were explored based on the absorbed energies and the microstructures, from which the feasibility of welding in cold weather was assessed. Referring to the results, significant drop of the low temperature impact fracture energy at the heat affected zone occurs due to the rapid cooling effects. Nevertheless, it is confirmed that the impact fracture energy of structural steel welded joints constructed at low ambient temperatures can be guaranteed for use in cold regions provided that proper precautions such as the use of low-hydrogen electrodes and suitable thermal control are taken during the welding process.

AB Photochemical hydrogen generation from water is a promising solution to concurrently tackle energy and environmental problems. However, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of most photocatalysts are still unsatisfactory due to two major limiting factors: the non-ideal band structure of photocatalysts and the fast recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Herein, we report a Janus-type TiO2 heterojunction consisting of ordered blue-anatase and disordered black-rutile phases fabricated by the magnesiothermic reduction process. In this process, the surface enthalpy difference of rutile and anatase phases in P25-TiO2 allows the phase-selective reduction to afford novel blue ordered/disordered Janus heterostructure. The joint effect of the improved light absorption and charge separation by the disordered black-rutile phase and the high catalytic activity of the ordered blue-anatase phase, as well as the morphological advantage over order@disorder core-shell structures, significantly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate to 1.56 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (11.53 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with similar to 1 wt% Pt), which delivers 13-fold enhancement compared to pristine P25-TiO2.

AB With the growing sophistication of offshore wind technology, the development of offshore wind-hydrogen system is evolving as a cost-efficient approach to harnessing far offshore wind resource. However, the costs associated with inter-array cables, the offshore hydrogen production platform (OHPP) and the hydrogen pipeline constitute a substantial portion of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for this hybrid system, underscoring the critical need for optimization in the distribution and transmission system design of offshore wind-hydrogen system. In this study, we introduce an integrated design model for the distribution and transmission system of this hybrid system, considering local wind conditions and various hydrogen production efficiencies, with the aim of minimizing investment cost, expected power losses cost and expected fault loss cost. Given the complexity of this problem, we employ a double-layer framework for solutions. The upper layer utilizes rigorous mathematical proofs to clarify the relationship between optimal OHPP capacity and its location. Meanwhile, the lower layer addresses a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for jointly optimizing the cable connection layout and OHPP position. Due to its intractability, we construct a relaxed mixed-integer secondorder cone programming (MISOCP) model and rigorously prove that its optimal solution aligns with that of the original problem. In our computational experiments, we found that the integrated design model reduces expected costs by an average of 3.88 % compared to solving subproblems separately. Compared with other optimization methods, our optimization framework is both concise and efficient, capable of finding a globally optimal solution within an acceptable timeframe. Lastly, sensitivity analysis reveals that even a slight increase in hydrogen production efficiency can significantly reduce expected costs, each 1 % improvement in efficiency reduces total cost by 0.94 %.

AB Modern arc processes, such as the modified spray arc (Mod. SA), have been developed for gas metal arc welding of high-strength structural steels with which even narrow weld seams can be welded. High-strength joints are subjected to increasingly stringent requirements in terms of welding processing and the resulting component performance. In the present work, this challenge is to be met by clarifying the influences on hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) in a high-strength structural steel S960QL. Adapted samples analogous to the self-restraint TEKKEN test are used and analyzed with respect to crack formation, microstructure, diffusible hydrogen concentration and residual stresses. The variation of the seam opening angle of the test seams is between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. To prevent HAC, the effectiveness of a dehydrogenation heat treatment (DHT) from the welding heat is investigated. As a result, the weld metals produced at reduced weld opening angle show slightly higher hydrogen concentrations on average. In addition, increased micro- as well as macro-crack formation can be observed on these weld metal samples. On all samples without DHT, cracks in the root notch occur due to HAC, which can be prevented by DHT immediately after welding.

AB The energy production market based on hydrogen technologies is an innovative solution that will allow the industry to achieve climate neutrality in the future in Poland and in the world. The paper presents the idea of using hydrogen as a modern energy carrier, and devices that, in cooperation with renewable energy sources, produce the so-called green hydrogen and the applicable legal acts that allow for the implementation of the new technology were analyzed. Energy transformation is inevitable, and according to reports on good practices in European Union countries, hydrogen and the hydrogen value chain (production, transport and transmission, storage, use in transport, and energy) have wide potential. Thanks to joint projects and subsidies from the EU, initiatives supporting hydrogen technologies are created, such as hydrogen clusters and hydrogen valleys, and EU and national strategic programs set the main goals. Poland is one of the leaders in hydrogen production both in the world and in Europe. Domestic tycoons from the energy, refining, and chemical industries are involved in the projects. Eight hydrogen valleys that have recently been created in Poland successfully implement the assumptions of the "Polish Hydrogen Strategy until 2030 with a perspective until 2040" and "Energy Policy of Poland until 2040", which are in line with the assumptions of the most important legal acts of the EU, including the European Union's energy and climate policy, the Green Deal, and the Fit for 55 Package. The review of the analysis of the development of hydrogen technologies in Poland shows that Poland does not differ from other European countries. As part of the assumptions of the European Hydrogen Strategy and the trend related to the management of energy surpluses, electrolyzers with a capacity of at least 6 GW will be installed in Poland in 2020-2024. It is also assumed that in the next phase, planned for 2025-2030, hydrogen will be a carrier in the energy system in Poland. Poland, as a member of the EU, is the creator of documents that take into account the assumptions of the European Union Commission and systematically implement the assumed goals. The strategy of activities supporting the development of hydrogen technologies in Poland and the value chain includes very extensive activities related to, among others, obtaining hydrogen, using hydrogen in transport, energy, and industry, developing human resources for the new economy, supporting the activities of hydrogen valley stakeholders, building hydrogen refueling stations, and cooperation among Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic as part of the HydrogenEagle project.

ID HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTROLYSIS; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; STEAM; PERFORMANCE
AB High-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) consists of the splitting of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature in solid oxide electrolyzers. Performing the electrolysis process at high temperatures offers the advantage of achieving higher efficiencies as compared to the conventional water electrolysis. Furthermore, this allows the direct use of process heat to generate steam. This paper is related to the FCH JU (Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking) project ADEL (ADvanced ELectrolyser For hydrogen Production with Renewable Energy Sources), which investigates different carbon-free energy sources to be coupled to the HTSE process. Renewable energy sources are able to provide the high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) process with heat and power. This paper investigates the capability of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies to provide the HTSE process with the necessary energy demand. The layout of the plant is shown in the following figure. The design of commercial-scale high-temperature steam electrolysis has been carried out. The HTSE plant is coupled to an air cooled solar tower. The configuration and the operating parameters of the solar tower are based on those of the solar tower of Julich (Germany), which is operated by DLR. This paper presents the results of process analysis performed to evaluate the hydrogen production from a HTSE plant coupled to an 80MWth air solar tower. Additionally, the dynamic behavior of the system during energy fluctuations has been analyzed. The receiver-to-hydrogen efficiency (based on the Higher Heating Value of hydrogen) is 26% at a hydrogen production rate of 680kg/h in steady-state operation. The overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is calculated to be at 18%. Moreover, the analysis under transient conditions shows that a steady-state operation of the plant is only possible for 8h.

AB Hydrogen has attracted much attention from governments and enterprises around the world due to its zero pollution and recycling use. However, it may bring safety problems such as hydrogen jet fire due to its wide flammability range and low ignition energy. Therefore, the methods of preventing hydrogen jet fire need to be explored urgently. In order to investigate the effect of gaseous fire extinguishing agent on the hydrogen jet fire, a series of experiments were carried out to study the flame behaviors under the effects of nitrogen and carbon dioxide jets. The fire extinguishing agents were released through a jet nozzle with diameter of 3 mm at the pressure of 11 atm. The flame length, thermal radiant flux and total heat flux were analyzed. The results show that the reduction ratio of vertical flame length increases with the decrease of the installation height of the extinguishing agent nozzle. It indicates that when the fire extinguishing agent is injected at the root of hydrogen jet flame, the fire may be extinguished. Due to the reduction of flame size, the thermal radiant flux received by the radiometer decreases, which corresponds to the reduction of flame radiation fraction. The total heat flux received in the downstream region of deflected flame is determined by the joint action of thermal radiation and convection. The convective heat transfer of high-temperature gas may cause the value measured by the heat flux meter on the flow path of the deflected flame to increase. Besides, the extinguishing limit for hydrogen jet flame under the effects of nitrogen and carbon dioxide jets are analyzed.

AB In this study, a special phenomenon of gas evolution in the metal droplet and melt pool during underwater wet welding was investigated by in-situ imaging method in a simulated deep-water environment. In general, the dissolved hydrogen escaped from molten droplet and molten pool in the form of bubbles during molten metal solidification. As the increase of hydrostatic pressure, the gas cannot expand enough to burst the droplet and release gas, but instead of entering into molten pool again. The combinations of the internal pressure in the bubble and hydrogen-rich atmosphere induced by welding arc resulted in that the melt pool has been subjected to dual influences. The diffusible hydrogen content in the deposited metal significantly increased from 23.3 to 66.3 ml/100 g with increasing the water depth to 150 m, which was related to the high hydrogen partial pressure and the rapid solidification rate of molten metal.

AB Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalysts were prepared using a joint precipitation method with acid-dissolved titanium slag as raw material for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide. The joint precipitation method was accomplished with different precipitants, such as sodium hydroxide, carbamide, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide. The deNOx activities of the catalysts prepared by different precipitants were investigated with SCR activity reactor within temperatures of 90-350 degrees C. It is evident that the Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalyst with carbamide-ammonia-hydrogen peroxide as precipitant has superior catalytic activity, which the NO conversion can reach 90% at 120 degrees C, with a wider temperature window (120-300 degrees C) for the NH3-SCR reaction. H-2-TPR results showed that the reduction potential of MnOx species on Mn-Ni/TiO2 catalysts is increased compared to that of Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Oxygen mobility is enhanced by interaction between Ni and Mn atoms due to use of carbamide-ammonia peroxide as precipitant. XPS results suggest that the presence of MnO2 is the major phase in nickel-doped Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Our NH3-TPD results illustrated that the catalysts have a lot of acid-active sites, which lead to attracting more ammonia to participate in the catalytic reaction.

AB Co-exposure of widely used single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and ubiquitous cadmium (Cd) to humans through ambient air is unavoidable. Studies on joint toxicity of SWCNTs and Cd in human cells are scarce. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of SWCNTs and Cd in human lung epithelial (A549) cells. Results showed that SWCNTs were safe while Cd induce significant toxicity to A549 cells. Remarkably, Cd-induced cell viability reduction, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, cell cycle arrest, dysregulation of apoptotic gene (p53, bax, bcl-2, casp3, and casp9), and mitochondrial membrane potential depletion were significantly mitigated following SWCNTs co-exposure. Cd-induced intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxidation were significantly attenuated by SWCNT co-exposure. Moreover, glutathione depletion and lower activity of antioxidant enzymes after Cd exposure were also effectively abrogated by co-exposure of SWCNTs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry study indicated that higher adsorption of Cd on SCWNTs might decreased cellular uptake and the toxic potential of Cd in A549 cells. Our work warranted further research to explore the potential mechanism of joint effects of SWCNTs and Cd at in vivo levels.

ID HYDROGEN
AB In many reactor containments Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PAR) are installed to mitigate the hydrogen threat in case of a severe nuclear reactor accident. PARs oxidize hydrogen catalytically into water vapor. The heat of catalytic reaction drives flow through the PAR unit by natural convection, which continuously brings "fresh" hydrogen-air mixtures to the PAR unit, thereby developing a self-sustained process until either hydrogen or oxygen falls below a minimum concentration. The test series (HR-33 to HR-35) of the OECD/NEA THAI-2 program investigated the influence of temperature, pressure and steam on the onset of hydrogen recombination in case of low or extremely low oxygen concen-trations. These conditions with oxygen concentrations below 1 vol-% can occur in accident scenarios (e.g. late accident phase with molten core concrete interaction). A better understanding of the PAR performance in oxygen-limited conditions is important for hydrogen management in severe accidents. The test data of HR-35 was used for a blind benchmark exercise within the OECD/NEA joint project. Lumped parameter codes (MELCOR and COCOSYS) have been used as well as 3D/CFD codes (GASFLOW, GOTHIC and CFX). A variety of PAR models were used, including models based on engineering correlations, models with a detailed nodalization of the PAR unit, and a model with detailed heat and mass transfer process (REKO-DIREKT). Consequently, the benchmark provided a good opportunity to assess the PAR models that are deployed in the state of the art safety analysis tools, especially under conditions representative for the late phase of a severe accident.

AB Nanoporous carbons remain the most promising candidates for effective hydrogen storage by physisorption in currently foreseen hydrogen-based scenarios of the world's energy future. An optimal sorbent meeting the current technological requirement has not been developed yet. Here we first review the storage limitations of currently available nanoporous carbons, then we discuss possible ways to improve their storage performance. We focus on two fundamental parameters determining the storage (the surface accessible for adsorption and hydrogen adsorption energy). We define numerically the values nanoporous carbons have to show to satisfy mobile application requirements at pressures lower than 120 bar. Possible necessary modifications of the topology and chemical compositions of carbon nanostructures are proposed and discussed. We indicate that pore wall fragmentation (nano-size graphene scaffolds) is a partial solution only, and chemical modifications of the carbon pore walls are required. The positive effects (and their limits) of the carbon substitutions by B and Be atoms are described. The experimental 'proof of concept' of the proposed strategies is also presented. We show that boron substituted nanoporous carbons prepared by a simple arc-discharge technique show a hydrogen adsorption energy twice as high as their pure carbon analogs. These preliminary results justify the continuation of the joint experimental and numerical research effort in this field.

AB Hydrogen production plus purification has been studied by the joint use of methane dry reforming (MDR) and the reduction-oxidation of iron oxides (Steam-Iron Process or SIP) within the same reactor. The raw material studied has been an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 simulating the composition of a biogas exempt of any other contaminant. The study has been mainly carried out by thermogravimetry, using mixtures of a catalyst and a doped iron oxide both synthesized in laboratory. The catalyst has been based in a nickel aluminate with nickel oxide in excess above its stoichiometric composition. The iron oxide indirectly "stores'' the hydrogen produced by MDR by becoming into its metallic state during the reduction step. This hydrogen is released later on during the oxidation step of the metal with steam. On this way, dry reforming reaction is displaced towards products (H-2 and CO) which are consumed "on site'' by the oxide. This cyclic process has demonstrated that the key issue to achieve the goal of hydrogen purity enough to be consumed in a PEMFC, is producing a metallic iron with low coke deposition and an acceptable inert role. The nature of the coke and the way in which it is deposited, have also been studied in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The forming, microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of three kinds of vacuum electron beam welded joints with different shapes were studied. The results of X-ray inspection of the joints showed that the three shapes of welded joints could meet the requirements of the quality inspection. The results of microstructure characterization show that the worm or bone-like 8-ferrite appears in the upper and lower regions of the funnel-shaped and bell-shaped joints, while only a small amount of 8-ferrite appears in the local regions of the nail-shaped joints. The test results of mechanical properties show that the micro-hardness of the weld center in the three kinds of shaped joints is the lowest. All the specimens fracture in the weld, and the bell-shaped weld presents the highest impact energy and bending load. Funnel-shaped weld shows the worst corrosion resistance due to the element segregation of the weld. Thus, the bell-shaped joint exhibits the best comprehensive performance.

AB A hydrogenated Zr interlayer was formed by cathodic charging and was subsequently used to facilitate the diffusion bonding of TC4 alloy. The microstructure and phase composition of the hydrogenated Zr were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TG). The hydride gamma phase precipitated from the supersaturated alpha(H) phase when the alpha(H) phase was charged with 0.15 wt.% hydrogen. When the hydrogen content reached 0.3 wt.%, the gamma phase completely transformed into the epsilon phase. The effects of hydrogen on the microstructure evolution and on the mechanical properties of the diffusion bonds were investigated by XRD and by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The interdiffusion coefficient and activation energy of the Ti-hydrogenated Zr diffusion couple were calculated using the Boltzmann-Matano method and Arrhenius' law. According to the experimental and computational results, the thickness of the diffusion layer and the shear strength of the diffusion bond increased drastically with increasing hydrogen content. Specifically, when 0.3 wt.% hydrogen was added into the Zr interlayer, the thicknesses of the diffusion layers of the joints bonded at 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C increased by 5 times and 1.2 times, respectively. The activation energy at the Zr-rich end was reduced by approximately 40 kJ mol(-1), and the interdiffusion coefficient increased accordingly by two orders of magnitude. Mechanisms for the hydrogen-induced enhancement of diffusion bonding are proposed. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Al/CFRP composite structure has the advantage of lightweight and high specific strength, making it a promising material for aviation, railway, and automotive applications. Silane coupling pretreatment is a chemical surface pretreatment method that can improve the mechanical properties of the Al/CFRP friction stir lap welding (FSLW) joint. To further investigate the strengthening mechanism of silane-treated Al/CFRP FSLW joint, a 6061-T6 Al/ CF-PA66 FSLW experiment was carried out and the finite element analysis (FEA) was used. The thermophysical properties of semi-crystalline resin during the welding process were also considered. The joining mechanism of silane surface pretreated Al/CFRP FSLW joints was further revealed by comparing the changes in interface morphology, temperature, stress, and mechanical properties. The results indicated that the silane coupling agent forms a silane film by an Al-O-Si chemical bond at the interface. The silane film can enhance the Al/CFRP interface's tightness and reduce interfacial defects. The FSLW process affected the joint morphology and mechanical properties through interfacial temperature and stress, which were decided by welding parameters and thermophysical properties of the resin. By adjusting the thermal-mechanical effect of the Al/CFRP interface, defects can be reduced and the joining force can be improved. According to the analysis of interfacial chemical bonds and mechanical properties, the introduction of silane film enhances the hydrogen bond between Al and resin and thus enhances the mechanical properties of the interface. This study provides a new method for revealing the strengthening mechanism of silane-pretreated FSLW Al/CFRP joint.

AB Stem cell therapy has revolutionized the management of osteoarthritis (OA), but the articular dysregulated redox status diminishes cell engraftment efficiency and disrupts immune homeostasis, therefore compromising the overall therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present hydrogen (H2) generators-backpacked mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which preserve the biological functions and survival of transplanted cells and reverse articular immune dysfunction, mitigating OA. Specifically, post systemic transplantation, H2 generators-laden MSCs home to OA joints, and upon stimulation in acidic OA environment, H2 produced from the generators remodels articular redox balance, thereby relieving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing cell apoptosis rate, and maintaining pluripotent and paracrine functions of MSCs. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species scavenging by H2 in combination with paracrine effects of the MSCs promote macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which contributes to reversing synovial immune disorder. In severe OA model, the backpacked MSCs reduce osteoarthritic degeneration, osteophyte formation and joint inflammation, and promote cartilage regeneration. In sum, our work demonstrates that arming with H2 generators effectively boosts the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, which hold great potential for alleviating redox imbalance-related tissue lesions, including but not limited to OA.

AB The effect of travel speed on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of friction stir welded 2024-T4 aluminum alloy was investigated by slow strain rate tensile test. Microstructure and microhardness of the welded joint were studied. The results showed that the size of second phase particles increased with increasing travel speed, and the distribution of second phase particles was much more homogeneous at lower travel speed. The minimum microhardness was located at the boundary of nugget zone and thermomechanically affected zone. In addition, the SCC susceptibility of the friction stir welded joint increased with the increase of travel speed, owing to the size and distribution of second phase particles in the welds. The anodic applied potentials of -700, -650, -600 mV, and cathodic applied potential of -1200 mV facilitated SCC while the cathodic applied potential of -1000 mV improved the SCC resistance. The SCC behavior was mainly controlled by the metal anodic dissolution at the open circuit potential, and hydrogen accelerated metal embrittlement.

AB Laser metal deposition process was introduced to join AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by powder bed fusion-laser beam/metal to improve the tensile strength of laser welded joints. The size and the porosity of the hydrogen pores in the weld seam are significantly reduced by laser metal deposition welding. The ultimate tensile strength of the welded joint by using laser metal deposition reaches 318.8 MPa, and the microhardness of the weld seam ranges from 99.5 to 105.4 HV. Compared with single-pass welding, the ultimate tensile strength and hardness are increased by 60.6% and 27.6%. This is mainly attributed to the reduced porosity, refined & alpha;-Al structures and increased connectivity of the Si-rich networks of the weld seam achieved by laser metal deposition welding.

AB In 5000 series (Al-Mg) alloys, hydrogen embrittlement (HE) becomes a concern when Mg content exceeds 5%. The local Mg content will become higher than 5% due to solidification segregation in the weld joint of 5083 alloy. In this study, resistance to HE of MIG-welded 5083 aluminum alloy at three areas (weld center, weld corner and HAZ) was investigated by newly developed humid gas stress corrosion cracking (HG-SCC) test. Slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) test on base metal and welded joint was also conducted for comparison.
   It was newly revealed that HG-SCC crack extends only in the sample of weld corner, confirming HE in this area. For the other areas, HG-SCC crack did not propagate, confirming HE resistance of these areas. From the results of SSRT test, neither the base nor welding material showed reduction in strength or ductility. Therefore, it was concluded that HE in 5083 MIG welds is only detectable by HG-SCC test. The reason for this should be in the fact that HG-SCC test can specifically test different local areas, while the softest area (weld center) always deforms preferentially and fractures in SSRT test.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate surface changes on dental implant systems and ions release after immersion in fluoride and hydrogen peroxide. Methods Ten implant-abutment assemblies were embedded in acrylic resin and cross-sectioned along the implant vertical axis. Samples were wet ground and polished. Delimited areas of groups of samples were immersed in 1.23% sodium fluoride gel (F) or in 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) for 16 min. Gels (n = 3) were collected from the implant surfaces and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to detect the concentration of metallic ions released from the implant systems. Selected areas of the abutment and implant (n = 15) were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results SEM images revealed surface topographic changes on implant-abutment joints after immersion in fluoride. Implants showed excessive oxidation within loss of material, while abutment surfaces revealed intergranular corrosion after immersion in fluoride. ICP-MS results revealed a high concentration of Ti, Al, V ions in fluoride after contact with the implant systems. Localized corrosion of implant systems could not be detected by SEM after immersion in hydrogen peroxide although the profilometry showed increase in roughness. ICP-MS showed the release of metallic ions in hydrogen peroxide medium after contact with dental implants. Conclusion Therapeutical substances such as fluorides and hydrogen peroxide can promote the degradation of titanium-based dental implant and abutments leading to the release of toxic ions.

AB Hydrogen-assisted cracking is a critical combination of local microstructure, mechanical load and hydrogen concentration. Welded microstructures of low-alloyed creep-resistant Cr-Mo-V steels show different hydrogen trapping kinetics. This influences the adsorbed hydrogen concentration as well as the diffusion by moderate or strong trapping. A common approach to describe hydrogen traps is by their activation energy that is necessary to release hydrogen from the trap. In the present study, Cr-Mo-V steel T24 (7CrMoVTiB10-10) base material and TIG weld metal were investigated. Electrochemically hydrogen charged specimens were analyzed by thermal desorption analysis (TDA) with different linear heating rates. The results show two different effects. At first, the microstructure effect on trapping is evident in terms of higher hydrogen concentrations in the weld metal and increased activation energy for hydrogen release. Secondly, it is necessary to monitor the real specimen temperature. A comparison between the adjusted heating rate and the real specimen temperature shows that the calculated activation energy varies by factor two. Thus, the trap character in case of the base material changes to irreversible at decreased temperature. Hence, the effect of the experimental procedure must be considered as well if evaluating TDA results. Finally, realistic temperature assessment is mandatory for calculation of activation energy via TDA.

AB This paper investigates the effects of substituents in PNP-type ruthenium complexes in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using the DFT method. Six groups were considered as substituents linked to the P atom of the PNP ligand: hydrogen, methyl, iso-propyl, tert-butyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. The substituent effects were analyzed from the perspectives of steric hindrance and promotion of hydrogen bonding. With the joint functions of steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding promotion during the CO2 coordination step, hydride addition step, and HCOO- rotation step, these groups exhibited very different substituent effects. The results showed that the methyl group was the most favorable substituent when the solvent's effects were not included, as it formed hydrogen bonding with relatively weak steric hindrance. The second favorable substituent was the iso-propyl group, while the tert-butyl group was the most unfavorable one, due to remarkable steric hindrance. When the substituent was cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, the complex provided a wider open space for the reaction compared with the tert-butyl-substituted complex, because cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl are cyclic groups. Therefore, the principle for choosing the substituent in PNP-type complexes allowing the design of highly efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation indicates that more hydrogen atoms but wider open space are ideal. In addition, the substituent's effects can be markedly impacted by the solvent used.

AB Bipolar plates are regarded as the core of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. In order to obtain a connected stainless steel bipolar plate with low residual stress and small deformation, the brazing process is commonly used for bipolar plate connection. In this study, a numerical model was developed to calculate the residual stress in a brazed joint. Clamp pressure, brazing gap, and solder type were investigated. The results showed that clamping pressure had little influence on residual stress and the residual stress decreased with an increase in the brazing gap, which provided a reference for controlling brazed residual stresses for stainless steel bipolar plates.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB This paper addresses the challenge of renewable energy curtailment, which stems from the inherent uncertainty and volatility of wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation, by developing a robust model predictive control (RMPC)-based scheduling strategy for an integrated wind-PV-hydrogen storage multi-energy flow system. By building a "wind-PV-hydrogen storage-fuel cell" collaborative system, the time and space complementarity of wind and PV is used to stabilize fluctuations, and the electrolyzer-hydrogen production-gas storage tank-fuel cell chain is used to absorb surplus power. A multi-time scale state-space model (SSM) including power balance equation, equipment constraints, and opportunity constraints is established. The RMPC scheduling framework is designed, taking the wind-PV joint probability scene generated by Copula and improved K-means and SSM state variables as inputs, and the improved genetic algorithm is used to solve the min-max robust optimization problem to achieve closed-loop control. Validation using real-world data from Xinjiang demonstrates a 57.83% reduction in grid power fluctuations under extreme conditions and a 58.41% decrease in renewable curtailment rates, markedly enhancing the local system's capacity to utilize wind and solar energy.

AB Electrodes with porous structures are widely used in commercial alkaline water splitting devices. By optimizing the porous structure, the efficiency of alkaline water splitting devices could be evidently promoted. In this work, nickel electrodes with gradient porosity distribution were designed and fabricated through selective laser melting. The effect of gradient porous distribution structure on electrochemical performance of Ni electrode was evaluated. The results showed that with small pores towards counter electrode the prepared Ni electrodes exhibits better anodic performance, and a better cathodic performance is observed with big pores towards the counter electrode. It was considered as joint effect of active specific area and mass transfer. Finally, by applying an electrolysis cell with optimized arrangement, an improvement of 14% electrolysis efficiency is achieved, which shows the potential of Ni electrodes with gradient porosity distribution to be applied in commercial application of hydrogen generation.

AB With the development of energy integration technology, demand response (DR) has gradually evolved into integrated demand response (IDR). In this study, for the integrated energy system (IES) on the distribution grid side with electricity, heat, natural gas network, and hydrogen energy equipment, the analogy relationship between the thermal and mobile hydrogen energy storage networks is proposed. Moreover, a unified model that reflects network commonalities across different energy forms is established. Then, considering the time delay of the IES in the nontransient network, a time-domain two-port model of the IES considering the time delay is established. This model shows the joint effect of time and space on system parameters. Finally, this study validates the model in the application of DR. The verification results show that in DR, the time-domain two-port model can accurately "cut peaks and fill valleys" for the IES and effectively reduce the operating cost of the IES system.

AB High temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with inherent safe characteristics has a potential to contribute to decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries by supplying a large amount of hydrogen and high temperature heat or steam without carbon dioxide emission. Promotion of R&D on HTGR and hydrogen production technology is stated in Japanese policies, e,g, The Sixth Strategic Energy Plan and Basic Policy for Realization of Green Transformation (GX). Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been conducting R&Ds for HTGR technologies with a central focus on the use of High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR). Based on the knowledge accumulated from the various HTTR's tests conducted so far, JAEA obtained the permission of changes to reactor installation in June 2020 and loss of forced cooing (LOFC) test which simulates the situation where the reactor cannot be cooled and shutdown as a joint the OECD/NEA international research project was carried out in January 2022. JAEA has launched the HTTR heat application test plan which demonstrate hydrogen production by coupling the HTTR with a hydrogen production test facility. The demonstration of hydrogen production is expected to be completed by 2030. Aiming for operation start from the latter half of 2030s, the basic design of the HTGR demonstration reactor is started from 2023. The Japan's HTGR technology capabilities established by the HTTR project will be fully utilized for the construction of HTGR demonstration reactor.

AB Methanol, as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier, exhibits advantageous features such as easy storage, transportability, and low energy consumption at ambient conditions, making it a reliable on-site emergency hydrogen source. The adoption of steam reforming allows for the efficient release of hydrogen from liquid organic hydrogen carriers, thus offering a promising solution to hydrogen storage and transport challenges. Moreover, leveraging renewable energy sources (solar energy) to replace conventional fossil fuels for powering methanol steam reforming (MSR) reactions enables the utilization of high-quality on-demand hydrogen sources with reduced carbon emissions. However, several challenges in solar-driven MSR research persist, encompassing catalyst lifespan, reaction rate, reaction stability, and environmental impact. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses recent advancements in solar-driven MSR, focusing on solar reactor design, development of control strategies for reaction systems, investigation of energy storage systems for reactors, as well as analysis of the photothermal coupling reaction mechanism. The primary aim is to share the latest progress in solar-driven MSR and identify common challenges and future research directions. Specifically, this paper focuses on the development of a joint active/passive control system, the establishment of a complementary energy supply system with multiple drive modes, the development of a low-temperature and high-efficiency conversion technology for the reactants, and the exploration of a synergistic gain mechanism for the coupling of photothermal energy in MSR reactions. Furthermore, it advocates for interdisciplinary design approaches to achieve seamless integration between solar energy supply systems and MSR reaction systems, thereby minimizing energy losses during the reaction process. The insights provided in this review offer novel perspectives and directions for the development of low-carbon hydrogen production processes.

AB The various mechanisms of primary antioxidant action of a series of 2-Methoxyphenols are investigated in the present work. The electronic properties have just been studied in a joint article, so that we focus here on Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT), Single Electron Transfer-Proton Transfer (SET-PT) and Sequential Proton-Loss Electron-Transfer (SPLET) mechanisms. The two computational approaches used in the previous study of the structure and reactivity of these compounds [Computational and Theoretical Chemistry 1229 (2023) 114287] provide identical mechanisms trends in gas phase. In gas media, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is more favored. On the contrary, the solvent polarity has a significant effect on the mechanism of the antioxidant activity, since the polarity of the solvent increases the contribution of the SPLET mechanism.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

ID PRESSURE
AB Hydrogen is expected to play a major role in the decarbonization of the energy grid. As a fuel, it possesses an elevated energy density per unit mass, about twice as much as natural gas but also a very low mass density; for this reason, it is preferably stored and transported at elevated pressures in the gas phase to achieve a comparable volumetric energy density. High strength quenched and tempered ferritic steels are widely used for gaseous hydrogen storage despite the fact that hydrogen affects material properties and result in higher fatigue crack growth rate and lower fracture toughness. This work presents the results of a comprehensive fracture toughness test program in gaseous hydrogen for the characterization of base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal on a high strength, quenched and tempered steel, suitable for the construction of hydrogen pressure equipment. Full penetration, butt welded joints were made using partly mechanized gas metal arc welding technique on a weldable, high strength steel, namely EN 101216-3 grade P690 QL2. Two different welding procedures were evaluated, and fracture toughness tests were conducted according to ASTM E1820 requirements, in high purity (99.9995%) hydrogen gas at a pressure of 200 bar on specimens extracted from base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal. While base metal and weld metal exhibited stable crack growth behavior, heat affected zone showed variable behavior as a function of the post-weld heat treatment conditions. It was found that local microhardness spots are a concern and should be controlled through dedicated post weld heat treatment operation to limit hardness values for use of welds in H2 gas conditions.

AB With the advantages of non-pollution and energy-saving, hydrogen fuel cell hybrid vehicles (HFCHVs) are regarded as one of the potential traveling ways in the future. The energy management of FCHVs has a huge energy-efficient potential which is combined with the Internet of Things (IOT) and auto-driving technologies. In this paper, a hierarchical joint optimization method that combines deep deterministic policy gradient and dynamic planning (DDPG-DP) for speed planning and energy management of the HFCHV is proposed for urban road driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that when the HFCHV is operating in driving scenario 1, the traveling efficiency of the DDPG-DP algorithm is 17.8% higher than that of the IDM-DP algorithm, and the hydrogen fuel consumption is reduced by 2.7%. In contrast, the difference in the traveling efficiency and fuel economy is small among the three algorithms in driving scenario 2, the number of idling/stop situations of the DDPG-DP algorithm is reduced compared with that of the IDM-DP algorithm. This will support further research for multi-objective eco-driving optimization of fuel cell hybrid vehicles.

ID GRAIN-SIZE; STAINLESS-STEELS; EMBRITTLEMENT; BOUNDARY; ENERGY
AB This study investigates the microstructure and hardness of weld metals used in liquid hydrogen storage tanks, with a focus on the effects of three welding methods: Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), Submerged Arc Welding (SAW), and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). Finite element simulations were employed to model the temperature field during welding, aiding in the explanation of observed microstructural differences. The results show that while GTAW and SMAW produce weld metals with similar microstructures, SAW generates significantly larger grains with a pronounced preferential orientation. The use of weaving techniques play a key role in shaping the solidification microstructures. Additionally, the hardness of the weld metal is comparable to that of the base material, with a slight reduction corresponding to increased grain size. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing welding processes for liquid hydrogen storage tanks by addressing the microstructural characteristics that influence weld joint performance.

AB A review of the microstructural evolution and phase transformation in the hydrogenated weld zone of Ti-0.3Mo-0.8Ni alloy argon-arc welded joints has been considered. The role of crystallographic, microstructural, and precipitation mechanisms on the defect-free properties of the hydrogenated weld zone has been analyzed, and hydride phase formations have been revealed by the influence of hydrogen on the microstructural characteristics of the weld zone. The results show face-centered cubic (FCC) and face-centered tetragonal (FCT) hydride phase formations are found in the hydrogenated 0.21wt% H weld zone. Large lamellar, slender plate and long needle hydrides can only precipitate from the alpha lamellae, and not from the transformed beta phase due to the high hydrogen solubility found in the beta phase. Formation of the and hydrides are the result of (H) phase separation reaction: (H) (H lean region)+ (H rich region) and (H) (H rich region), respectively. The precipitation mechanisms and characteristics of the and hydrides formed in alpha phase are discussed in detail. Dislocation multiplication around the hydrides is promoted effectively by hydrogen addition, the fact that the quantity of dislocations around the hydride increased obviously compared to hydride indicated the (H) phase transformation result in a greater volume expansion rate.

AB This paper presents the corrosion test results of 9% Ni steels (ASTM A522 type 1 and ASTM A333 grade 8) in presence of aqueous solutions containing H2S and CO2. A forged bar and a seamless pipe, manufactured to be used in high-pressure CO2 lines, were tested by NACE TM0177, TM0284, and ISO 7539-2. Localized corrosion and cracks were observed in the sulfide stress cracking (SSC) tests, in both base materials, and welded joint. These types of attack were associated to specific metallurgical features of the products (forged bar and seamless pipe), indicating that a better evaluation of the corrosion resistance of these materials is necessary. No hydrogen induced cracking damage was detected after the standard testing time, but microcracks were identified, reducing the impact energy levels. The welded joint presented high susceptibility to SSC cracking.

AB The photochemistry of the ethyl radical following excitation to the 3p Rydberg state is investigated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Velocity map images for hydrogen atoms detected from photoexcited isotopologues CH3CH2, CH3CD2 and CD3CH2 at similar to 201 nm, are discussed along with high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations of potential energy curves and non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACME). A novel mechanism governed by a conical intersection allowing prompt site-specific hydrogen-atom elimination is presented and discussed. For this mechanism to occur, an initial ro-vibrational excitation is allocated to the radical permitting to access this reaction pathway and thus to control the ethyl photochemistry. While hydrogen-atom elimination from cold ethyl radicals occurs through internal conversion into lower electronic states followed by slow statistical dissociation, prompt site-specific C-alpha elimination into CH3CH + H, occurring through a fast non-adiabatic crossing to a valence bound state followed by dissociation through a conical intersection, is accessed by means of an initial ro-vibrational energy content into the radical. The role of a particularly effective vibrational promoting mode in this prompt photochemical reaction pathway is discussed.

AB Pd-alloy membrane tubes are used for hydrogen isotopes separation in the fusion fuel cycle. The efficiency of these separation processes has been significantly increased by the adoption of thin-walled self-supported membrane tubes that exhibit high permeance and infinite selectivity to hydrogen. A critical aspect in the realization of Pd-based membrane devices (both separators and membrane reactors) is related to the joining of the thin-walled tubes to the membrane module. In this work, an innovative fitting of thin-walled tubes has been obtained by coupling two special stainless steel joints (a weld adapter and a sealing insert) that tighten the flared edge of the tube. In particular, the design of the compression fitting relies on the elastic deformation reserve of the conical edge of the sealing insert that is capable: i) to ensure the sealing of the joining also in presence of the expansion/contraction of the Pd-Ag alloy during the hydrogenation cycling, and ii) to compensate small irregularities of the thin-walled tube (thickness, circularity, etc.). The effectiveness of the new joining technique in terms of both hydrogen perm-selectivity and stability has been verified in preliminary permeations tests.

AB Hydrogen-based power generation could increase the sustainability and efficiency of future energy systems due to the higher storing capabilities resulting from the higher gravimetric density of hydrogen energy. This work proposes a hydrogen-based multi-carrier energy system (HMES) comprising renewable energy resource (RES), electricity, and hydrogen markets as input energy carriers and power, cooling, and heating as demands. Thermal water storage and hydrogen tank storage are considered to improve energy efficiency. This system uses the full capacity of intermittent wind and solar energy to increase RES utilization and decrease carbon emissions simultaneously. The environmental and economic goals of the proposed HMES are satisfied through the weighted-sum multi-objective method. The trade-off solution between operation and emission costs is ultimately obtained through the max-min fuzzy method. Chance constraint programming (CCP), which offers decisionmakers a variety of risk-taker strategies, is utilized as a tool to manage the risk associated with stochastic optimization. The confidence level of the CCP determines the risk tolerated by the decision-maker, improving the optimization process by creating a more realistic approach to risk management in real-world models. The results show the benefits of hydrogen tank by reducing operation costs by 4.5% and importance of CCP leading to operation costs reduction.

TI An ESIPT-based AIE fluorescent probe to visualize mitochondrial hydrogen
   peroxide and its application in living cells and rheumatoid arthritis
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID NRF2
AB As a chronic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause progressive damage to joints and various organs. Hydrogen peroxide plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of RA and thus serves as a biomarker for diagnosing this disease. Although fluorescent probes have emerged as promising tools for detecting H2O2, most available ones suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, short-wavelength emission, low sensitivity, and poor water solubility. Herein, a new type of "turn-on" AIE probe based on excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) was developed, with phenylboronic acid pinacol ester-appended quinolinium as the H2O2 recognition site, which is in the quenched state due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. The probe HTQ-R exhibits good water solubility, high sensitivity, a low detection limit (210 nM), rapid response ability, and good biocompatibility towards hydrogen peroxide, and has shown the ability to accurately target mitochondria. Furthermore, HTQ-R was successfully used to detect exogenous and endogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells, which enabled real-time monitoring of H2O2 in RA mice, demonstrating its potential significance in the diagnosis and treatment of RA.

AB Tungsten heavy alloys (THA) are used in the defense industry for subcaliber bullet cores due to their high density and strength. Typically methods of joining tungsten rod elements include: soldering, friction welding or threaded sleeve splicing. The properties of the joints were tested for three types of material containing 90.8, 96.2 and 98.2 wt.%. tungsten, density from 17.3 to 18.4 g/cm(3) and strength range 400-1000 MPa. Combination in the liquid phase at the sintering temperature was carried out in a vacuum furnace at a temperature of 1520 degrees C in a hydrogen atmosphere, and tests used pairs of both identical and dissimilar materials. After that, some of the bars were subjected to additional heat treatment at 1100 degrees C for 3 h. The tests of the mechanical properties in the static tensile test and the measurement of impact strength showed that the obtained strength of the joints was comparable to that of the parent material. The microstructure analysis showed that the resulting joint area, while maintaining the appropriate roughness of the joined end faces of the bars, is homogeneous without areas of the solidified matrix of the joint line. Research showed that it is possible to bond under sintering conditions with the participation of a solid liquid phase of homonymous and dissimilar THA materials. The strength of joints in dissimilar materials was comparable to a tungsten heavy alloy material with lower strength in the bonded pair while homonymous materials were comparable to the original material. The test results provided a good basis for further research in which the obtained pairs of joints will be subjected to plastic working processes.

AB Common crustal igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks contain peroxy defects which remain dormant until the rock experiences stress upon deformation. Stress activated peroxy defects form highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the rock-water interface observed in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial rock samples. The ROS complex is formed upon rock fluid interaction when groundwater combines with the ROS to produce hydrogen peroxide giving an indirect measure of the underlying rock stress and crustal deformation along active faults. The average concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the Sohna thermal spring water falling along the active Sohna fault and geothermal field was measured to be similar to 0.53 +/- 0.014 mg/l. Similar average concentration was also recorded from borewell sample north of the spring (similar to 0.56 +/- 0.017 mg/l) within the same geothermal field. Lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide was recorded within samples collected from hard rock aquifers outside the geothermal field and the active fault zone (similar to 0.138 +/- 0.095 mg/l). The detailed analysis suggests that the presence of hydrogen peroxide is largely dependent on the circulation pattern through the interconnected fractures/joints within the quartzite bedrock lying adjacent to the fault plane. Laboratory analysis results also show high hydrogen peroxide concentration within two borewell samples falling adjacent to the epicentre of a shallow microtremor event within the hard rock region falling alongside a lineament along the Delhi hard rock mega fold. Rock water interaction post stress activation of peroxy defects and formation of ROS has therefore been inferred to be responsible for the formation of hydrogen peroxide at the rock water interface within these zones. This pilot study provides scientific field evidence that hydrogen peroxide concentrations within groundwaters might offer prospects for seismic stress estimation and crustal deformation along seismically active zones.

AB Hydrogen production from renewable electrolysis is a suitable transformative technology for driving a cleaner energy mix, mitigating climate change, and achieving sustainable development and has been given the color value definition of "green hydrogen". However, this low-carbon technology is still in its infancy, and the pathways for expanding market supply have not been analyzed. To address the problems of unclear factors influencing the diffusion of green hydrogen technology innovation, unclear technology diffusion laws, and inaccurate predictions of regional green hydrogen production capacity under the goal of decarbonization policy, this work constructs a spatial assessment framework of the feasibility of low-carbon technology development in response to climate change on the basis of the theory of technological innovation systems, the improved technology diffusion model, and the feasibility of climate change spatial concepts to analyze and predict the diffusion law and regional green hydrogen production capacity of hydrogen production by renewable energy under the goal of carbon neutrality. The results of the study on the development of renewable hydrogen technology in China show that it follows the law of diffusion of low-carbon technologies in both the formation and growth stages. The diffusion of green hydrogen technology in the formation stage is slow, and the regional green hydrogen capacity in the near term cannot meet the decarbonization policy target demand in 2030. Before the spatial inflection point of technology diffusion feasibility, the demand-pull of the phase decarbonization policy target dominated the stability and sustainability of the green hydrogen supply market. After the inflection point, the internal growth of technology diffusion plays a key role in market diffusion and ultimately reaches a saturation value under the joint regulation of policy and the market to realize a carbon-neutral target capacity demand in 2060. The uncertainty of diffusion model parameters leads to anomalies in the feasibility space of technology diffusion, and risks such as overcapacity or insufficient demand in some regions may occur. Overall, this work provides a systematic assessment system for analyzing and predicting the pathways and characteristics of expanding renewable hydrogen production in specific regions under decarbonization policy objectives.

AB Background: Because hydrogen therapy has been found beneficial for the treatment of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress in humans, it seems useful to evaluate the effects of exogenously administered hydrogen as an element in the immediate management of sports-related soft tissue injuries. The main aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of 2-week administration of hydrogen on the biochemical markers of inflammation and functional recovery in male professional athletes after acute soft tissue injury. Method: During the 2013 season (from March to May), 36 professional athletes were recruited as participants and examined by a certified sports medicine specialist in the first 24 hours after an injury was sustained. Subjects were allocated to 3 randomly assigned trials in a single-blind design. Those in the control group received a traditional treatment protocol for soft tissue injury. Subjects in the first experimental group followed the same procedures as the control group but with additional administration throughout the study of oral hydrogen-rich tablets (2 g per day). Subjects in the second experimental group also followed the procedures of the control group, with additional administration throughout the study of both oral hydrogen-rich tablets (2 g per day) and topical hydrogen-rich packs (6 times per day for 20 minutes). Participants were evaluated at the time of the injury report and at 7 and 14 days after baseline testing. Results: Oral and topical hydrogen intervention was found to augment plasma viscosity decrease as compared with the control group (P = 0.04). Differences were found for range-of-motion recovery between the 3 groups; oral and topical hydrogen intervention resulted in a faster return to normal joint range of motion for both flexion and extension of the injured limb as compared with the control intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These preliminary results support the hypothesis that the addition of hydrogen to traditional treatment protocols is potentially effective in the treatment of soft tissue injuries in male professional athletes.

AB The welding of ultra-high hard armour (UHA) steel is highly challenging due to their higher hardness (600 HV) and higher carbon equivalent (0.80). In this investigation, 15-mm-thick UHA steel plates are welded by shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process using three different consumables such as austenitic stainless steel (ASS), low-hydrogen ferritic steel (LHF), and duplex stainless steel (DSS). The joints were tested against a 7.62 x 54 mm Armor-piercing (AP) projectile. All three joints successfully stopped the projectile at weld metal and interface (weld/HAZ) without perforation. The ballistic performance and mechanical properties are improved than the currently used ASS electrodes, and a new method to study the mode of failure at weld metal and interface was introduced. Striations and microcracks are preferred modes of failure than wear debris in the weld metal, and soft/hard mode is preferred over soft/soft and hard/hard modes of failure at the interface.

AB Compared to other structural alloys, magnesium alloys have a relatively poor corrosion resistance and low mechanical strength, which can be further deteriorated when these alloys are subjected to joining processes using the existing joining methods. Herein, we propose for the first time an additive friction stir-welding (AFSW) using fine Al powder as an additive to improve the mechanical strength as well as corrosion resistance of AZ31B weld joints. AFSW is a solid-state welding method of forming a high-Al AZ31B joint via an in-situ reaction between pure Al powders filled in a machined groove and the AZ31B matrix. To optimize the process parameters, AFSW was performed under different rotational and transverse speeds, and number of passes, using tools with a square or screw pin. In particular, to fabricate a weld zone, where the Al was homogenously dispersed, the effects of the groove shape were investigated using three types of grooves: surface one-line groove, surface-symmetric grooves, and inserted symmetric grooves. The homogenous and defect-less AFS-welded AZ31B joint was successfully fabricated with the following optimal parameters: 1400 rpm, 25 mm/min, four passes, inserted symmetric grooves, and the tool with a square pin. The AFSW fully dissolved the additive Al into & alpha;-Mg and in-situ precipitated Mg 17 Al 12 particles, which was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The microhardness, joint efficiency, and elongation at the fracture point of the AFS-welded AZ31B joint were 80 HV, 101%, and 8.9%, respectively. These values are higher than those obtained for the FS-welded AZ31 joint in previous studies. The corrosion resistance of the AFS-welded AZ31B joint, evaluated via hydrogen evolution measurements and potentiodynamic polarization tests, was enhanced to 55% relative to the FS-welded AZ31B joint.& COPY; 2022 Chongqing University.

AB This paper focuses on an experimental study of the explosive decompression on representative samples of the hyperbaric type IV hydrogen storage vessels. The adhesion of the composite to the liner is achieved by different adhesives. The bond behavior of liner-to composite bonded joint considerably depends on the properties of adhesives, as well as the assembly process. X-ray tomography allows determining the damages before and after explosive decompression tests. Tomographic observations have revealed a certain level of porosity due to the assembly process with plasma treatment. This porosity influences the damage mechanisms induced by explosive decompression. Results show that 1) the increasing of the maximum hydrogen pressure (differential pressure induced during the depressurization step between the liner/adhesive interface or the adhesive/composite) increases the risk of liner collapse for the same gas exposure conditions, 2) Compared with soft adhesive, the stiff adhesive has proven better adhesion between the composite and the liner, 3) the flame treatment improved the surface energy of the PA6 and subsequently increased the collapse limit pressure, 4) adhesive RCA-20 with plasma preparation can be defined as a kind of low strength to collapse adhesive with a collapse limit pressure less than 2 MPa, 5)adhesive RCA-2000 with flame treatment can be defined as a kind of high strength to collapse adhesive in the present report with a collapse limit pressure between 15 MPa and 17.5 MPa.

AB The weak intermolecular forces of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) make it relatively difficult to synthesize and design HOFs with superprotonic conductivity and robustness. The self-assembly of ionic hydrogen bonding organic frameworks (iHOFs) through acid-base pairing strategies are possible on account of the rich hydrogen bonding, strong ionic bonding, and pi-pi stacking interactions and so on. Herein, a case of iHOF (<bold>iHOF-16</bold>) with a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogen bonding network is reported, the doughty ionic bond interactions in the structure and pi-pi stacking interactions between layers make it exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, it can maintain high crystallinity and robust structure even under extreme conditions. Importantly, <bold>iHOF-16</bold> exhibits highly anisotropic proton conductivity of 0.388, 5.56 x 10(-3), and 3.25 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) in the direction of a-axis, b-axis, and c-axis, respectively. The proton transfer paths of single crystal on each axis are calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and, supported by joint experimental-theoretical calculations, protons are most easily transported in the a-axis direction resulting in superprotonic conductivity. The present study provides a promising approach for the design of stable superprotonic conductivity materials through a simple yet effective charge-assisted synthesis strategy.

AB The new hydrogen-containing integrated energy system proposed in this paper has complementary coupling of multiple energy forms such as electricity, gas, cold, heat, and hydrogen. For the same type of load demand, equipment with different energy input forms can be dispatched for joint supply. However, different equipment differ in dynamic response speed and energy utilization efficiency, and the reasonable configuration of equipment capacity will directly affect the overall dynamic characteristics and energy efficiency level of the system. Therefore, this paper first proposes an evaluation index that can comprehensively characterize the dynamic energy efficiency and load tracking ability of energy equipment. In addition, a preference adjustable capacity configuration optimization method based on utopian point tracking is proposed with the two optimization objectives of this indicator and the system's equivalent annualized investment cost, and the solution complexity is reduced through segmented linearization of the objective. Simulations presented here show that the capacity configuration optimization method proposed in this paper has a positive effect on improving the dynamic energy efficiency and load tracking ability of the new hydrogen-containing integrated energy system, and can also meet the preference setting needs of different investment entities for capacity configuration optimization goals.

AB Doping regulation holds promise to modulate electrocatalytic performance, yet it remains largely unexplored for ferroelectric (FE) BaTiO3 (BTO). By jointly employing first-principles calculations and machine learning (ML) analysis, we examine the effect of a broad range of transition metal (TM) doping in FE BTO on the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and screen out the optimal TM dopants. We unveil that some early-to-middle group TM (V, Cr, Mo, Ta, Ru)-doped BTO surfaces feature higher synthesizability, which also exhibit noticeable HER activity with |Delta G(H*)| < 0.2 eV owing to intermediate hydrogen adsorption strength. Among all doped surfaces, the Mo-doped one shows optimal HER activity under both out-of-plane and in-plane polarization states. We reveal an intense interplay between the hydrogen adsorption configuration and the corresponding hydrogen bonding interaction, which relies more on the TM group than the polarization state. Most importantly, we propose a physically informed descriptor of the surface oxygen p band, which better describes HER activity trends of TM-doped surfaces than conventional band descriptors.This indicates the significance of the fractional filling and bandwidth of occupied oxygen p-band states. Moreover, we establish a robust ML model that can well predict HER activity with surface-independent input parameters alone with R-2 value above 0.93. From these parameters, we identify the inherent outer electron number of the TM dopant as the dominant feature, while the second ionization energy of the TM dopant and the initial polarization state show non-negligible feature importance. These findings could enlighten understanding, rational design, and accelerated discovery of element doping of FE materials for catalysis and other implications.

AB In this paper, we report a joint experimental and computational study to elaborate the mechanism for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Experimental results indicate that the catalyst (sodium magnesium chlorophyll, MgChlNa(2)), which has a well-defined structure for calculation and understanding, can achieve the photoreduction of CO2 to CO only using water as a dispersant, without adding any photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. Subsequently, a series of structural models of the hydrogen-bonded complexes of the catalyst were constructed and outlined via utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, including photophysical and photochemical processes. The results confirm that the rate-limiting step of the whole CO2RR was the intersystem crossing process. The electron and proton transfers involved in photophysical and photochemical processes are induced by hydrogen bonds in the excited states. The combination of experiments and calculations will provide an important reference for the design of high-efficiency photocatalysts in the photocatalytic CO2RR.

AB Methodological improvements in both single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) mean that the two methods are being more frequently used together to tackle complex problems in structural biology. There are many benefits to this combination, including for the analysis of low-resolution density, for structural validation, in the analysis of individual proteins versus the same proteins in large complexes, studies of allostery, protein quality control during cryo-EM construct optimization, and in the study of protein movements/dynamics during function. As will be highlighted in this review, through careful considerations of potential sample and conformational heterogeneity, many joint studies have recently been demonstrated, and many future studies using this combination are anticipated.

AB Titanium alloys have high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance and have been applied in deep-sea engineering fields. However, stress corrosion cracking may become one of the biggest threats to the service safety of a high-strength titanium alloy, as well as its weldment. In this work, stress corrosion cracking of a gas-tungsten-arc-welded Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo (Ti6321) alloy influenced by the applied potentials in simulated deep-sea and shallow-sea environments was investigated by combining slow strain rate testing with electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the service environment and applied potential have a substantial effect on the stress corrosion cracking behavior of the Ti6321 welded joint. The Ti6321 welded joint exhibited higher stress corrosion susceptibility in a simulated deep-sea environment and at a strong polarization level owing to the diminishing protection of the passive film under passivation inhibition and the enhancement of the hydrogen effect. The fracture of a Ti6321 welded joint in the weld material could be attributed to the softening effect of the thick secondary alpha within the coarse-grained martensite. The electrochemical evaluation model of stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of a Ti6321 welded joint in a simulated marine environment was established by adding the criterion in the passivation region based on the literature model, and four potential regions corresponding to different stress corrosion cracking mechanisms were classified and discussed. Our study provides useful guidance for the deep-sea engineering applications of Ti6321 alloys and a rapid assessment method of stress corrosion risk.

AB This study investigated the resistance effect of Sodium-Silicate solution coated on the welding zone surface on stress corrosion cracking, which was caused by the penetration of storage hydrogen into micro cracks. This phenomenon occasionally occurred while welding the joint with gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) between the bottle cover and body fabricated using aluminum alloy 7075 (Al-Zn-Mg). The coating effect of Sodium-Silicate was evaluated using four factors, namely, hardening agent, solidification method, coating thickness, and baking temperature. Taguchi analysis was applied to determine the optimal parameters, which were then used to effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the welding zone. The corrosion resistance of the group added with magnesium oxide as a hardening agent increased to 200% compared with the group added with Sodium-Silicate but without hardening agent. The penetration depth of the tested group added with talc as a hardening agent also increased to 20%. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]qinoline (PQ) and 2-(2 '-pyridyl)pyrrole (PP) are important systems in the study of proton-transfer reactions. These molecules possess hydrogen bond donor (pyrrole) and acceptor (pyridine) groups, which leads to the formation of cyclic dimers in their crystals. Herein, we present a joint experimental (Raman scattering) and computational (DFT modelling) study on the high-pressure behaviour of PQ and PP molecular crystals. Our results indicate that compression up to 10 GPa (100 kbar) leads to considerable strengthening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond within the cyclic dimers. However, the intramolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot N interaction is either weakly affected by pressure, as witnessed in PQ, or weakened due to compression-induced distortions of the molecule, as was found for PP. Therefore, we propose that the compression of these systems should facilitate double proton transfer within the cyclic dimers of PQ and PP, while intramolecular transfer should either remain unaffected (for PQ) or weakened (for PP).

AB The plate-fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is the core equipment used to achieve the high effi-ciency of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), however, the issues of high-performance brazed joints in the manufacturing of the PFHE have been a challenge due to the poor mechanical properties. This study proposes a brazing manufacturing technology of isothermal solidi-fication with the optimized post bonding heat treatment strategy, to synergistically improve the strength-ductility property and homogenize microstructure of brazed joints, aiming at guaranteeing the high energy efficiency of SOFC. The results show that brazing at 1065 degrees C for 25 min achieves the complete isothermal solidification and an intermetallic-free joint centerline with numerous borides generating in the diffusion-affected zone. Solution treatment then dissolves large quantities of acicular and blocky borides. The uniformity of grain size and kernel average misorientation distribution is also improved due to recrys-tallization, which becomes more pronounced after solution aging treatment. In addition, solution aging treatment results in an improvement in the ultimate tensile strength of the brazed joint, which is more prominent than that after solution treatment. However, the increase in elongation after solution aging treatment is smaller than after solution treat-ment, while still much higher than the as-brazed joint due to the dissolution of boride precipitates and growth of twin boundaries. The results demonstrate that the proposed brazing manufacturing technology not only homogenizes microstructure, but also signifi-cantly improves strength and ductility, further promoting the long-life operation of SOFC.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Welding of AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) has been recently conducted to meet the demands for joining or repairing them. However, high susceptibility to porosity occurring in weld metal (WM) poses a significant challenge for fusion welding of AM AlSi10Mg alloys. The laser metal deposition (LMD) process has emerged as a promising welding solution due to its low dilution rate for reducing the porosity. In this study, LMD welding of AM AlSi10Mg alloys was carried out employing different heat inputs with five and eight tracks. The study systematically assessed the impact of heat input on porosity, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the welded joints. The results show that the decrease of heat input from 180 to 75 J/mm results in a substantial reduction in porosity from 7.0 to 2.1%. This reduction leads to a 29.4% increase in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and an 11.7% increase in elongation index (EI). Furthermore, the upper region of joints with eight tracks possessing low heat input displays lower porosity and superior mechanical properties than the bottom region with relatively high heat input. The WM with eight tracks exhibits refined alpha-Al cells and Si-rich eutectic phases, improved connectivity of Si-rich networks, and increased solid solution strengthening, compared to the five-track joints with higher heat input. As a result, low heat input of the upper region in the LMD welded joints has been effective in minimizing hydrogen pores, enhancing WM microstructure, and improving the mechanical properties of welded joints in AM AlSi10Mg alloys.

AB Most of weld defects occurring in the welding of martensitic stainless steels are caused by the presence of hydrogen. Thus, the effects of hydrogen in the weld zone need to be well-understood to estimate the quality and service life of martensitic stainless steel joints. In the present study, AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel materials were welded by using different combinations of shielding gas via the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) method. It is known that shielding gases also play a critical role in heat input, cooling rate, microstructure of weld seam, weld defects, and mechanical properties besides drying of molten weld pool. Thus, it is important to investigate the effects of shielding gases and gas combinations on the welding of martensitic stainless steels in the welding process. In the present study, 100 % Ar, 97 % Ar + 3 % H-2 and 93 % Ar + 7 % H-2 gas combinations were employed. The welded sheets were subjected to the metallographic examination as well as hardness, tensile, and bending tests. The effect of the tests and the combination of shielding gas on the mechanical and microstructural properties of AISI 420 stainless steel was investigated. The results indicated that a noticeable grain coarsening occurred in the microstructure of the weld metal and heat affected zones (HAZs) after the addition of H-2 into the Ar gas during the welding process. The highest tensile strength was obtained from the joints with 100 % Ar gas. As a result of the tensile test, rupture occurred in the base metal-HAZ transition zone in all the welded samples. In the joints welded with 97 % Ar + 3 % H-2 and 93 % Ar + 7 % H-2 gas combinations, fracture occurred in the base metal-HAZ transition zone during the bending test.

AB This paper presents an experimental study of turbulent non-premixed jet flames of ethylene/nitrogen where the nitrogen is substituted with different proportions of hydrogen and/or ammonia. The focus is largely on the effects of hydrogen and ammonia on soot production in turbulent flames. A combination of pointwise, laser-induced fluorescence in the visible and UV bands (LIF-UV-visible), and laser-induced incandescence (LII) is used to measure soot precursors and soot along the flame centerline. All signals are collected at a repetition rate of 10 Hz with fast photomultiplier tubes to resolve the time decay. In a separate experiment, joint imaging of LIF-OH-CH is also performed at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. Hydrogen substitution is found to increase the production of soot, whereas ammonia substitution inhibits soot formation. The peak mean soot volume fraction is almost a factor of 3 lower in the 25% ammonia case in comparison to the 25% nitrogen case. The mean signal decay time constant decreases with ammonia substitution, implying the formation of smaller soot nanoparticles. The mean signal decay time constant remains unaffected with hydrogen substitution. Measured peaks in LIF-CH and LIF-OH are reduced with ammonia substitution but only in regions upstream of where soot is formed. Further downstream in the sooting region, neither OH nor CH appear to be affected by the substitution of N-2 with H-2 or NH3. (c) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Phenomenal study of microbial impact on hydrogen storage in aquifers: A

ID ENHANCED OIL-RECOVERY; PERMEABILITY; VISCOSITY; TRANSPORT; ENERGY
AB Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) has been considered as an integral part of energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Porous aquifers can serve as typical sites for this purpose due to their worldwide distribution and huge storage capacity. However, the diverse microbial species that inhabit the aquifers are known to be able to catalyze in-situ biochemical reactions within the hosting rock. These reactions can normally lead to microbial consumption of hydrogen, microbial clogging of pore space and thus affect hydrogen injection and withdrawal rates as reported in the literature. So far, these phenomena have been widely reported but rarely quantified. In this study, we build a coupled hydrological-mechanical-chemical-biological (HMCB) multiphysics model to simulate these microbe-related processes during UHS in aquifers. The model consists of a complete set of partial differential equations to describe: (1) rock deformation; (2) water-hydrogen two-phase flow; (3) microbes and dissolved hydrogen transport; (4) mineral dissolution/precipitation; and (5) microbial activities involving adsorption/desorption and growth/decay. All these processes are linked together through the porosity/ permeability models which consider the joint impacts of microbial clogging, mineral dissolution/precipitation and effective stress. This multiphysics model is verified against laboratory biochemical reaction data and microbial transport data. Then, the verified model is used to investigate the impacts of iron-reduction bacteria (IRB) activities on UHS in aquifers. Based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that (1) hydrogen saturation at the top surface of the aquifer is the greatest while microbial activities surrounding the injection well is stimulated the most; (2) microbial activities influence the initial few cycles of hydrogen injection and withdrawal but the impacts gradually diminish with the dissolution of Fe2O3; 2 O 3 ; (3) hydrogen recovery efficiency is degraded due to the combined effects of hydrogen consumption, water production and microbial clogging with the microbial clogging impact being the most significant; and (4) effective stress impacts aquifer permeability throughout UHS operations while microbial clogging influences it in the initial few cycles. For mineral dissolution/precipitation, the impact can be neglected.

SO MENDELEEV COMMUNICATIONS

ID POTENT; S18986; SHAPE
AB Positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptor are prospective for the development of safe and efficacious agents for the correction of disruption of the central nervous system functions. Joint application of molecular docking, MFTA and CoMFA QSAR modelling, and pharmacophore analysis affords a consistent picture of structural requirements for molecular design of novel promising bivalent modulators with high activity, including overall twisted-staple shape of a molecule, hydrophobic central core, and polar hydrogen bond acceptor groups in peripheral parts of a molecule.

AB Aviation has become an essential part of the modern world's ability to grow personal, market and international connections. To enable continued benefits while reducing emissions, future aircraft will need radical redesign and novel, complementary technologies. Hydrogen aircraft are potentially the means to emissions reduction. As part of the European Union's (EU's) Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU), it is aimed to have hydrogen aircraft entering into service by 2035. To realise this, it would require the certification of these aircraft in a relatively short timeline, which the CONCERTO project aims to help enable. Given the lack of mature experimental designs and pending certification processes, this endeavour is ambitious. To accelerate this, dedicated preparation for the certification through regulatory analysis should be complete, requiring initial options for technologies and aircraft operations to be defined. The technologies and operations were defined, analysed and weighted in CONCERTO, upon which a Generic Concept was made, outlined in this paper, with Level 1 on the Certification Readiness Level Scale. The aircraft systems which are likely to experience the largest changes; Fuel Storage, Fuel Distribution, Propulsion, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Heat Exchange (HEX) System and Sensing and Monitoring for Hydrogen (H2), will be outlined in this paper with respect to their components and integration challenges, and the subsequent changes to operations to enable this.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) are critical electron donors and acceptors to promote the anaerobic and aerobic microbial transformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), respectively. Electrochemical technology can effectively supply H-2 and O-2 directly to an aquifer. However, the response of CHC transformation and microbial community structure to joint H-2 and O-2 are still unclear. In this work, microcosms containing different combinations of H-2 and O-2 were constructed with natural sediments and nine mixed CHCs. The joint H-2 and O-2 microcosm (H-2/O-2 microcosm) significantly promoted the biotransformation of trichloroethylene (TCE), trans-dichloroethene (tDCE) and chloroform (CF). Illumina sequencing analyses suggested that a particular microbial community was formed in the H-2/O-2 microcosm. The specific microbial species included Methyloversatilis, Dechloromonas, Sediminibacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Curvibacter, Comamonas and Acidovorax, and the relative abundance of the tceA, phe and soxB genes synchronously increased. These results suggested that some specific microbes are potential CHC converters using H-2 and O-2 as energy sources, and aerobic and anaerobic transformations exist simultaneously in the H-2/O-2 microcosm. It provides a theoretical basis for establishing efficient green remediation technologies for CHC contaminated aquifers.

AB A novel low-temperature sealing method was developed to seal solid oxide fuel cells. The 3D Ni nanosheet array was pre-fabricated on faying surfaces of Crofer22APU interconnect and NiO-YSZ anode-support. Then it was covered with Au film without changing its morphology. This special nanostructure improved sintering efficiency between Ag nano particles and substrates. A dense joint was obtained at the low-temperature between 250 degrees C-300 degrees C. This method effectively avoided the oxidation of interconnect during sealing. When joints were sealed at 300 degrees C, the shear strength reached 16 MPa. The fracture was mainly located in the central Ag layer, presenting a significant plastic deformation. Due to the effective protection of Ni layer, joints also possessed excellent oxidation resistance in oxidizing atmosphere at 800 C for 400 h. After high-temperature oxidation, the shear strength was increased to 23 MPa, revealing an increasement of 43.8% compared with the as-sealed condition (16 MPa). This sealing method has great potential in sealing solid oxide fuel cells. It also can be extended to seal other energy-conversion devices. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Amino 2-(2 '-hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives are a class of molecules with excellent photophysical properties. Most of them can be applied as a fluorescent probe via the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. In this work, we focus on the effects of heteroatoms (O, S) and substituents (acetylacetone, hydrogen) in the derivatives. Using DFT/TDDFT methods with the B3LYP-D3BJ functionals, the absorption and emission peaks are in good agreement with the experimental data. Results of optimized structures, infrared vibrational spectra, and reduced density gradient present the existence of the ESIPT process in the S1 state in these molecules, it also indirectly shows that the heteroatom S is more than O, and the substituent acetylacetone is more than hydrogen has stronger hydrogen bonds. The proton transfer (PT) potential energy curves (PECs) qualitatively show that it is easier for the heteroatom S to induce ESIPT than that of O. The same for the substituent acetylacetone than that of hydrogen. Under the joint influence of the simultaneous stacking of heteroatom S and acetylacetone substituent, the energy barrier of the PT process can be effectively lowered, realizing a synergistic strategy, which can provide some guidance for the design of fluorescent materials.

AB We present a joint theoretical-experimental study on the inner-shell photoionization of hypoxanthine clusters in the gas phase. Simulations were performed using a computational strategy that combines molecular dynamics to explore the conformers of the clusters, density functional theory for geometry optimization and inner shell photoionization calculations. Two main intermolecular interactions are observed: hydrogen-bonds (HB) and pi - pi stacking. When increasing the cluster size, a combination of both kinds of interaction occurs. We show that such intermolecular interactions play a role in the chemical shift observed in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy experiments. In particular, we highlight the interplay between charge depletion and charge accumulation in regions where HBs stabilize the clusters.

AB We report a joint experimental (X-ray and neutron diffraction) and computational study on a binary mixture of ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), a protic ionic liquid, and methanol, the shortest alcohol. These two amphiphilic compounds are also characterized by the existence of an extended hydrogen bonding network in their neat states. We explore how these similar compounds structurally organize at the micro- and mesoscopic levels when mixed in a homogeneous state. The study demonstrates that the mixture is organized similarly to neat EAN, where the polar versus apolar dualism of the ionic liquid determines the segregation of alkyl tails into domains embedded into the ionic, percolating matrix. Methanol, due to the strong hydrogen bond with the nitrate anion, tends to intrude into this polar network, merging at EAN's polar-apolar interface. Further studies are proposed to rationalize the emerging mesoscopic density fluctuations that develop when approaching methanol-rich conditions.

AB Polycarbonate-based thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (PCD-TPUs) were synthesized from polyhexamethylene carbonate diol, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 1,4 butanediol, intended for adhesive applications. The chemical structure, thermal transition temperature, phase separation morphology, mechanical properties, and adhesion properties were studied to elucidate the structure-properties relationship of PCD-TPUs as a function of hard segment content. The phase separation behavior was described as a shift of the glass transition temperature and the dimension size of the hard domain. It was found that the higher hard segment fraction led to a lower degree of phase separation as well as a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break. The hydrogen bonding characteristic of PCD-TPUs was investigated by FTIR. The presence of free hydrogen bonded PCD-TPUs benefits the higher peel strength since it promotes hydrogen bonding interaction with the substrate. The peel strength was obtained from PCD-TPUs/stainless steel joint. The adhesion properties of the adhesive system were strongly influenced by the soft segment. These results can establish the possibility of designing new formulations for hot melt adhesive.

AB In this study we investigate the mechanochemical regeneration of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) from a system comprising hydrated sodium metaborate (NaBO2 center dot 4 H2O) and magnesium hydride (MgH2). We explore the individual and joint impact of key operational parameters (rotational speed, milling time, ball-to-powder ratio (BPR), and molar ratio) on the regeneration yield. Furthermore, a method for quantifying chemical conversion is introduced relying only on water and thus, offering environmental benefits. This approach additionally facilitates the production and storage of a "ready-to-use"NaBH4 solution with minimal losses at room temperature. Notably, a yield of 90% is achieved, with a 20% reduction in rotational speed compared to prior literature. This research contributes to sustainable hydrogen storage and presents practical advancements in mechanochemical processes.

AB The economic competitiveness of the current fleet of light water reactors may be improved by coupling nuclear reactors to industrial facilities. This will allow flexible use high-quality steam or electric power from the reactor when the cost of electricity is low compared to the generation cost. One promising application is hydrogen production. Understanding the nuclear plant response to steam offtake is important for safe operation of the reactor facility. Conceptual analysis has been performed for coupling pressurized water reactors (PWRs) to high temperature steam electrolysis hydrogen production; however, corresponding work done for boiling water re-actors (BWRs) has not been published, even though BWRs make up 30% of the US operating fleet. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of coupling a generic BWR to a hydrogen production facility. The system response is analyzed for a 15% reduction in the electrical power output. This work shows that when steam is extracted from the main steam header without appropriate controls modifications, reactor power will increase beyond 100% rated power. We present addition analysis to maintain power below rated conditions by varying feedwater recirculation pump speeds.

AB The reactions of ruthenium clusters, Ru-x(+) (x = 2-5), and ruthenium oxide clusters, RuxOy+ (x = 2-5, y = 1-2), with water molecules have been investigated by gas phase ion trap mass spectrometry and first principle density functional calculations. The joint experimental and theoretical study reveals that the reactions of the ruthenium oxide clusters with water are considerably more efficient. This is assigned theoretically to the stronger binding of the water molecules to RuxOy+ and, more importantly, to water activation leading to an efficient hydrogen transfer reaction from the water molecules to the oxygen atoms of the ruthenium oxide clusters. The theoretically predicted hydrogen shift reaction has been confirmed experimentally through O-16/O-18 isotope exchange experiments. Calculated energy profiles for the reactions of selected oxide clusters with water illustrate that the oxygen isotope exchange relies on the facile transfer of hydrogen atoms via [1,3] shift reactions between the oxygen atoms of the complexes due to the relatively low barriers involved. These findings might open perspectives for the future realization of water oxidation driven by ruthenium oxide clusters.

AB The isotope effect on intrinsic rotation was studied at the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak. With the unique capability of JET to operate with tritium (T), for the first time, experiments in hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and T in Ohmic plasmas were compared. Two rotation reversals per isotope type are observed in plasma density scans spanning the linear and the saturated Ohmic confinement regimes. A clear isotope mass dependence is observed at the higher densities. The magnitude of the core rotation was found to depend on isotope mass, with stronger co-current rotation observed in H. Change on intrinsic rotation characteristics coexist with a stronger thermal energy confinement in T.

AB EH40 ship steel was underwater wet-welded by shielded metal-arc welding at a depth of 7 m in the open sea, using austenitic electrodes. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the joint were estimated with microhardness measurements, bending and tensile testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The highest microhardness was recorded on the coarse-grained heat-affected zone of the base metal, which displayed a mixed bainite-martensite microstructure, while the welds possessed a fully columnar dendritic austenitic structure. The specimens exhibited higher ultimate strength and elongation in longitudinal tensile tests than in transverse ones. Moreover, the specimens satisfied face bending tests but failed in root bending ones. Hydrogen-induced microcracks, which were observed in a lath martensite layer at the fusion boundary, became the fracture initiation region both in bending and transverse tensile tests.

AB The sole H2 and O2 usually promote chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) biotransformation by several mechanisms, in-cluding reductive dechlorination and aerobic oxidation. However, the mechanism of the CHCs transformation in joint H2 and O2 system (H2/O2 system) is still unclear. In this study, the degradation kinetics of trichloroethene (TCE) were investigated and DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) were used to explore the synergistic mechanism of functional microorganisms on TCE degradation under the condition of H2/O2 coexistence. In the H2/O2 microcosm, TCE was sig-nificantly removed by 13.00 mu M within 40 days, much higher than N2, H2 and O2 microcosms, and 1,1-DCE was de-tected as an intermediate. DNA-SIP technology identified three anaerobic TCE metabolizers, five aerobic TCE metabolizers, nine hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB), some TCE metabolizers utilizing limited O2, and some anaer-obic dechlorinating bacteria reductively using H2 to dechlorinate TCE. It is also confirmed for the first time that 3 OUTs belonging to Methyloversatilis and SH-PL14 can simultaneously utilize H2 and O2 as energy sources to grow and metabolize TCE or 1,1-DCE. HOB may provide carbon sources or electron acceptors or donors for TCE biotransfor-mation. These findings confirm the coexistence of anaerobic and aerobic TCE metabolizers and degraders, which syn-ergistically promoted the conversion of TCE in the joint H2/O2 system. Our results provide more information about the functional microbe resources and synergetic mechanisms for TCE degradation.

AB Hydrogen (H2) therapy is a new and effective approach for treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Nevertheless, the non-polarity and poor solubility of H2 under physiological status lead to its limited therapeutic effect. Here, we developed spatially separated Au/TiO2 nanodumbbells (NDs) as H2 generators and further conjugated them with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides (labeled R-Au/TiO2) to achieve inflammatory joint targeting for precise treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Au/TiO2 NDs structure combines the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation of gold nanorods (Au NRs) and Schottky junction to exhibit very efficient photocatalytic H2 production under near-infrared light irradiation. In situ generated H2 gas acts as an active ingredient to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and clear inflammation. Through active H2 scavenging of ROS and inflammation, R-Au/TiO2 alleviated oxidative stress and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, showing considerable reduction in joint destruction and suppression of arthritis severity in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Furthermore, the photothermal properties of R-Au/TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) endow them with photothermal therapeutic effects, which synergize with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress of H2, further enhancing the therapeutic effect. Therefore, R-Au/TiO2 NPs show great promise for treating RA and advancing clinical translation.

AB We studied the long-term corrosion behavior of carbide/316L stainless steel joints brazed with AgCuX alloys (X = Ti, In). The results show that the Cu-based solid solution (Cu (s,s)) in the brazing alloy is the weak link of corrosion germination. Ti increases the Fermi level and decreases the *H adsorption energy (delta G(*H)) of Cu(s,s), thus leading to a higher thermodynamic tendency of hydrogen evolution. In contrast, In decreases the Fermi level and the d band center of Cu (s, s) leading to a positive delta G(*H), which improves the corrosion resistance. The results agree with the mechanical performance tests.

AB Despite the success of standard antiseptic irrigation solutions in reducing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) rates, there is still a need for more effective solutions. Synergistic use of povidone-iodine (PI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has shown promising results; however, the optimal solution concentration balancing bactericidal activity and osseointegration remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the impact of these antiseptic irrigation solutions on osseointegration and the bone-implant interface strength in vivo. Forty C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral tibial implantation surgery and were randomly allocated into three groups receiving 0.3% PI, 10% PI mixed with 3% H2O2, or saline as irrigation solutions intraoperatively. Assessments were performed on postoperative Days 1 and 28, including plain radiographs, microcomputed tomography (microCT) evaluation, histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and biomechanical pull-out testing. No wound complications were observed. MicroCT scans revealed no differences in peri-implant trabecular bone parameters. Biomechanical pull-out testing showed no differences in the bone-implant interface strength across groups. Histological analysis indicated no differences in bone and bone marrow percentage areas among treatment groups. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated no differences among groups in peri-implant osteocalcin, osterix, or endomucin-positive cells. In conclusion, using either antiseptic irrigation solution showed no differences in osseointegration parameters compared to the control group, demonstrating safety and the absence of toxicity.Clinical RelevanceDilute 0.3% povidone-iodine and a 1:1 combination of 10% povidone-iodine mixed with 3% hydrogen peroxide can be safely used during primary and revision total joint arthroplasty without compromising osseointegration or causing wound complications.

AB The design of future electricity systems depends, among others, on reducing costs for renewable technologies. Particularly costs for PV panels and batteries are predicted to decrease significantly. At the same time, as the share of renewable energies increases, there is a greater need for flexibility. Energy policies are promoting the use of hydrogen generated by electricity which offers an alternative to provide flexibility to the system. This study investigates flexibility provision due to the coupling of the electricity and hydrogen sector in Europe in 2050 with a cost optimization model. The results show that investment cost reductions lead to a balanced contribution of wind and solar energy in the optimal generation mix but requires immense transmission and storage capacities. Batteries balance the daily feed-in from PV panels, whereas salt caverns with low-capacity costs compensate the irregular availability of wind resources. Implementing joint optimization can reduce total costs by up to 14%, while the coupling of electricity and hydrogen sectors can decrease electrical storage needs by 35% and substitute 40% of electrical transmission capacity. It also improves the integration of renewable energies and reduces curtailment by two-thirds. Thus, this coupling offers valuable additions in providing flexibility to the energy system.

AB 30CrMo steel is a core material for oil and gas field equipment (e.g., sucker rods, drill pipe joints), but its long-term service in sulfur-containing downhole often causes stress corrosion cracking (SCC) failure. This study systematically elucidates the SCC behavior of 30CrMo steel under H2S simulation systems constructed with chloride-containing acidic thiosulfate of different concentrations. Tests showed the corrosion rate exhibited a non-monotonic relationship with thiosulfate concentration, peaking at 0.340 mm/yin 1 x 10-2mol/L solution, with a dense FeOOH layer and loose mackinawite layer formed on the surface. Severe pitting (maximum depth 99.73 mu m) occurred at 1 x 10-3 mol/L, accompanied by the highest subsurface hydrogen concentration. Moreover, the SCC mechanism evolved with concentration: low (1 x 10-4 mol/L) and high (1 x 10-1 mol/L) dominated by anodic dissolution (AD) and Hydrogen Enhanced Local Plasticity (HELP); intermediate (1 x 10-3-1 x 10-2 mol/L) exhibited significant synergy between AD and Hydrogen Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE). This study revealed thiosulfate concentration's regulatory effect on 30CrMo steel's HE-SCC behavior, providing a simple, safe new strategy for service safety assessment of sulfur-containing oil and gas field equipment materials.

Herein, we present a novel catalyst with 2D/3D multistage structure for the electro-oxidation of renewable biomass and harmful waste to assist hydrogen generation. The hierarchical configuration of NiO/CoO nanosheets interconnected by hollow carbon spheres, leveraging both 2D and 3D advantages. This structure provides rich surface and edge active sites as well as affluent electron and mass transfer pathways, resulting in the accelerated dynamics of electro-oxidation. The hollow carbon spheres serve as a buffering agent to alleviate the strain caused by repetitive redox reactions during electrolysis, thereby bestowing exceptional structural and chemical stability for prolonged operational durability. Additionally, the multiple continuous hetero-interfaces between NiO and CoO, NiO and carbon as well as CoO and carbon can ensure the fast electron transport, leading to the expedited reaction kinetics with the synergistic effect of phase engineering between NiO, CoO and carbon shell. As a result, the 3D carbon shells jointed 2D NiO/CoO hybrids demonstrate promising catalytic activities on electro-oxidation for energy-efficient hydrogen production (similar to 100 %(FE)) coupled with urea oxidation and formic acid synthesis with excellent selectivity (95.40 %) and satisfied faradic efficiency (91.6 %).

AB Objective: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator produced in the body. In experimental models, endogenously produced H2S has been shown to have pro-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether H2S is present in three common rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout and osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine if H2S levels correlate with disease activity.
   Methods: Patients with RA, gout, OA, and healthy controls (n = 30 each) were recruited. Plasma and where possible, synovial fluid (SF), were obtained. Levels of H2S and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (a known inflammatory marker as a positive control) were determined and assessed for their relationship with disease activity.
   Results: SF-H2S levels were significantly elevated in both RA and gout when compared to respective plasma levels. Plasma levels of H2S were not different from those in healthy controls in patients with either RA or gout. In OA, plasma levels of H2S were significantly elevated compared to healthy controls. In RA, SF-H2S levels correlated with Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28 and tender joint count.
   Conclusion: H2S is present in the joint and acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator in rheumatic diseases. H2S may be a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.

AB In this paper, comparative experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between the welding procedure used (autogenous and non-autogenous welding) and the mechanical properties in association with the corresponding microstructures of laser beam welded AA2915 plates without the removal of surface oxide layer. The results showed that significant reduction in quantity and size of hydrogen-induced pores could be obtained by using conventional filler wire AA4047 (Al12Si) in comparison with the autogenous welds which led to relatively higher mechanical properties with the tensile strength approaching 59.5% of the base metal along the rolling orientation. The morphologies and distribution feature of the solidified structures of the experimental workpieces were analyzed in the light of 3D finite element model. Deep etching was incorporated to induce the contrast for clear observation of secondary phases. The results indicate that the grain structure of non-autogenous welded joints was more stable against the changes in welding process parameters due to the relatively higher constitutional undercooling at the growth front of the solidifying grains. The addition of Si was believed to decrease the absorbed hydrogen volume via diluting the content of Cu and Li in the welded seam, thereby decreasing the porosity and improving the mechanical properties.

TI Effects of temperature and mass conservation on the typical chemical
   sequences of hydrogen oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; VALIDATION; MODEL
AB Macroscopic properties of reacting mixtures are necessary to design synthetic strategies, determine yield, and improve the energy and atom efficiency of many chemical processes. The set of time-ordered sequences of chemical species are one representation of the evolution from reactants to products. However, only a fraction of the possible sequences is typical, having the majority of the joint probability and characterizing the succession of chemical nonequilibrium states. Here, we extend a variational measure of typicality and apply it to atomistic simulations of a model for hydrogen oxidation over a range of temperatures. We demonstrate an information-theoretic methodology to identify typical sequences under the constraints of mass conservation. Including these constraints leads to an improved ability to learn the chemical sequence mechanism from experimentally accessible data. From these typical sequences, we show that two quantities defining the variational typical set of sequences-the joint entropy rate and the topological entropy rate-increase linearly with temperature. These results suggest that, away from explosion limits, data over a narrow range of thermodynamic parameters could be sufficient to extrapolate these typical features of combustion chemistry to other conditions.

AB The paper analyzes the technical state of the hydrogen sulfide absorber of the catalytic reforming unit and hydraulic cleaning containing hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide with its operation time of 168,200 h (21 yr). 17G1S manganese-silicon steel is used in the absorber structure. In operation, in the vessel shell, a cone-shaped region of subsurface metal lamination is developed across the entire periphery. The region is under constant observation using the methods of nondestructive testing. In case the region of the damaged metal intersects the longitudinal welded joint, the vessel shell is being repaired. A low-temperature (to the boiling point) hydrogen-related fracture of metal in the petroleum refining due to hydrogen saturation and its accompanying cracking are considered to be the most critical types of corrosion of oilfield equipment. In view of this, a set of laboratory tests using specimens of metal templates cut out of the damaged shell region has been performed to evaluate the serviceability of the absorber, as well as to determine the effect of hydrogen sulfide on the structure and mechanical characteristics of the metal. It is found that the process of lamination is detected inside the metal intersection and is caused by the macroinhomogeneity of rolled metal, i.e., the axial segregation zone, which is the most critical region of the deformed metal. X-ray phase analysis lends credence to the metallurgical nature of lamination of the shell plate. The results of metallographic examination imply that the subsurface hydrogen-induced cracking is caused by aggregation of brittle refined nonmetallic inclusions, mainly of MnS, and it propagates chiefly over sulfide films along the rolled metal direction. The results of experimental investigations on the specimens are provided. From the fractographic investigations on the fractured surface of specimens after mechanical testing it is established that the process of fracture is ductile occurring via microvoids coalescence in the fracture of bridges between them. The key mechanism of microvoids formation is the inhomogeneity of the plastic strain in the micro-volumes around the nonmetallic inclusions.

AB Chloroform (CHCl3) and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) are model systems for the study of intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and halogen-halogen interactions. Here we report a joint computational (density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) modelling) and experimental (Raman scattering) study on the behaviour of the crystals of these compounds up to a pressure of 32 GPa. Comparing the experimental information on the Raman band positions and intensities with the results of calculations enabled us to characterize the pressure-induced evolution of the crystal structure of both compounds. We find that the previously proposed P6(3) phase of CHCl3 is in fact a metastable structure, and that up to 32 GPa the ambient-pressure Pnma structure is the ground state polymorph of this compound. For CH2Cl2 we confirm the stability of the ambient-pressure Pbcn structure up to 32 GPa. We show that the high-pressure evolution of the crystal geometry of CHCl3 in the Pnma structure is a result of the subtle balance between dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds and Cl center dot center dot center dot Cl contacts. For CH2Cl2 (Pbcn structure) the dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds are the main factors influencing the pressure-induced changes in the geometry.

AB Hydrogen-bonded, side-chain-functionalized supramolecular poly(alkyl methacrylate)s were investigated as light- and temperature-responsive reversible adhesives that are useful for bonding and debonding on demand applications. Here, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was functionalized with 2-ureido-4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) via a hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDI) linker, to create a monomer (UPy-HMDI-HEMA) that serves to form supramolecular cross-links by way of forming quadruple hydrogen bonded dimers. UPy-HMDI-HEMA was copolymerized with either hexyl methacrylate or butyl meth acrylate to create copolymers comprising 2.5, 5, or 10 mol % of the cross-linker. The mechanical properties of all (co)polymers were investigated with stress strain experiments and dynamic mechanical analysis. Furthermore, the adhesive properties were studied at temperatures between 20 and 60 degrees C by testing single lap joints formed with stainless steel substrates. It was found that increasing the concentration of the UPy-HMDI-HEMA cross-linker leads to improved mechanical and adhesive properties at elevated temperatures. Concurrently, the reversibility of the bond formation remained unaffected, where rebonded samples displayed the same adhesive strength as regularly bonded samples. Debonding on demand abilities were also tested exemplarily for one copolymer, which for light-induced debonding experiments was blended with a UV-absorber that served as light heat converter. Single lap joints were subjected to a constant force and heated or irradiated with UV light until debonding occurred. The necessary debonding temperature was comparable for direct heating and UV irradiation and varied between 28 and 82 degrees C, depending on the applied force. The latter also influenced the debonding time, which under the chosen conditions ranged from 30 s to 12 min.

TI Optical Measurements of a Lower Calorific Values-Combustor Operated in a

SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB In a recent joint research project, a new FLOX (R)-combustion system was developed to couple a fixed-bed gasifier with a micro gas turbine (MGT). Product gases from biomass gasification exhibit low calorific values and varying compositions of mainly H-2, CO, CO2, N-2, and CH4. Furthermore, combustion characteristics differ significantly compared to the commonly used natural gas. As the FLOX-technology is considered as efficient and fuel-flexible featuring low emissions of hazardous pollutants, the design of the lower calorific value (LCV) combustor is based on it. It contains a two-staged combustor consisting of a jet-stabilized main stage adapted from the FLOX-concept combined with a swirl stabilized pilot stage. The combustor was operated in a Turbec T100 test rig using an optically accessible combustion chamber, which allowed OH*-chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF measurements for various fuel compositions. In particular, the hydrogen content in the synthetically mixed fuel gas was varied from 0% to 30%. The exhaust gas composition was additionally analyzed regarding CO, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons. The results provide a comprehensive insight into the flame behavior during turbine operation. Efficient combustion and stable operation of the MGT was observed for all fuel compositions, while the hydrogen showed a strong influence. It is remarkable that with hydrogen contents higher than 9%, no OH radicals were detected within the inner recirculation zone, while they were increasingly entrained below hydrogen contents of 9%. Without hydrogen, the inner recirculation zone was completely filled with OH radicals and the highest concentrations were detected there. Therefore, the results indicate a different flame behavior with low and high hydrogen contents. Although the flame shape and position were affected, pollutant emissions remained consistently below 10 ppm based on 15% O-2. Only in the case of 0% hydrogen, CO-emissions increased to 43 ppm, which are still meeting the emission limits. Thus, the combustor allows operation with syngases having hydrogen contents from 0% to 30%.

AB Mimicking anisotropic features is crucial for developing artificial load-bearing soft tissues such as menisci). Here, a high-density hydrogen bond locking (HDHBL) strategy, involving preloading a poly(N-acryloylsemicarbazide) (PNASC) hydrogel with an aqueous solution containing a hydrogen bond breaking agent, followed by water exchange, to fabricate anisotropic high-strength hydrogels are proposed. During this process, multiple high-density hydrogen bonds of the PNASC network are re-established, firmly freezing oriented molecular chains, and creating a network with an anisotropic microstructure. The resulting anisotropic hydrogels exhibit superior mechanical properties: tensile strength over 9 MPa, Young's modulus exceeding 120 MPa along the orientation direction, and fatigue thresholds exceeding 1900 J m-2. These properties meet the mechanical demands for load-bearing tissue substitutes compared to other reported anti-fatigue hydrogels. This strategy enables the construction of an anisotropic meniscal scaffold composed of circumferentially oriented microfibers by preloading a digital light processing-3D printed PNASC hydrogel-based wedge-shaped construct with a resilient poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) hydrogel. The 12-week implantation of a meniscus scaffold in rabbit knee joints after meniscectomy demonstrates a chondroprotective effect on the femoral condyle and tibial plateau, substantially ameliorating the progression of osteoarthritis. The HDHBL strategy enables the fabrication of various anisotropic polymer hydrogels, broadening their scope of application.
   A high-density hydrogen-bond locking strategy is proposed for customizing circumferentially anisotropic meniscal skeletons. It involves preloading digital light processing 3D-printed highly stiff gels, followed by water exchange to reconstruct multiple hydrogen bonds, freezing the molecular chains and anisotropic microstructures. Biomimetic meniscus scaffolds, fabricated by infilling the resilient hydrogel into a stiff skeleton, efficiently protect articular cartilage and alleviate osteoarthritis progression. image

AB Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common subtype of arthritis. To date, treatment of OA focuses primarily on alleviating pain and improving joint function. The lack of a vascular system within synovial joints and the rapid removal of agents due to synovial exchange hinder continuous delivery of OA drugs. However, these obstacles are being addressed by promising nanoscale drugs.
   Methods: We synthesize and assemble a hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, belongs to the category of active oxygen species (ROS)]-sensitive nanomicelle, which is loaded with the anti-inflammation drug dexamethasone and chondrogenic differentiation factor cartilage-derivedmor-phogeneticprotein-1. The micelle can induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage while inhibiting joint inflammation.
   Results: The prepared nanoparticles were of uniform size and displayed an obvious core-shell structure. Under H2O2 stimulation, the shell layer could be removed gradually. The drug-loaded micelle effectively inhibited proliferation of activated macrophages, induced macrophage apoptosis with an anti-inflammatory effect, and caused the BMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes.
   Conclusion: This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for further development of a drug-loaded micelle in the healing of osteoarthritis.

The sorbent-sorbate complex is formed due to electrostatic interactions between protonated amino groups in chitosan and carboanions of glucuronic acid in saponin, as well as hydrogen bonding between NH2 and OH groups in chitosan molecules and OH groups in the carbohydrate moiety of saponin molecules.

AB The bonding properties at the interface between the first wall oxide dispersion strengthened tungsten (ODS-W) and the heat sink copper (Cu) are vital for their application in future nuclear fusion reactors. However, the immiscibility and significant differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion between ODS-W and Cu pose considerable challenges for bonding these two materials. This study utilizes anodization and hydrogen reduction processes to form a nanoporous structure on the surface of ODS-W, thereby achieving effective bonding between ODS-W and Cu by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of the anodization parameters on the surface characteristics of ODS-W, and the influence of the bonding temperature on the interfacial microstructure and mechanical properties of the ODS-W/Cu joints were investigated. The results demonstrate that under an anodization condition of 50 V for 40 min, a nanoporous structure with an average pore size of about 90 nm can forms on the surfaces of ODS-W. This significantly increases the surface roughness, thereby enhancing the interfacial bonding of ODS-W with Cu during SPS. As the bonding temperature increases, the interfacial microstructure changes from linear to serrated shape, effectively suppressing crack propagation and forming a stronger mechanical interlock between ODS-W and Cu. This significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the joints. Typically, at a bonding temperature of 1000 degrees C, the tensile strength of the anodized ODS-W/Cu joints reaches 245.2 MPa, which is 157.9 % higher than that of directly bonded joints. Additionally, the tensile fracture primarily occurs within the Cu substrate, transitioning from brittle to ductile fracture modes.

AB The joint international project between Niigata University (Japan) and the Korea Institute of Energy Research, KIER (Korea) on "Solar Demonstration of Water-Splitting Reactor using Ceramic Foam Device" has two goals. (1) Develop a solar reactor using reactive cerium oxide foam devices for high-temperature two-step thermochemical water-splitting cycle. (2) Test its performance under various operational methods using a 40 kW(th) solar furnace driven by natural solar energy. The reactive CeO2/MPSZ (MgO partially stabilized zirconia) foam device for two-step water-splitting was developed and prepared by Niigata University/Japan; it involves coating an inert zirconia foam matrix with reactive CeO2. In this paper, highly reactive CeO2 particles were used the redox material in CeO2/MPSZ foam devices to investigate the use of solar energy for hydrogen production. The solar-driven thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle was demonstrated using the 40 kWth KIER solar furnace in Korea combined with the CeO2/MPSZ foam device. At the center of the foam device, temperatures were 1500 degrees C-1600 degrees C during the thermal reduction step and 600 degrees C-1100 degrees C during the subsequent water decomposition step. Hydrogen was successfully produced from the CeO2/MPSZ foam device, and profiles for hydrogen production and CeO2 conversion indicated definitely improved operations compared to earlier studies.

ID FUEL; OPTIMIZATION
AB With the continuous development of hydrogen power generation devices, the application of hydrogen internal combustion engines (HICE), fuel cells (FC) and other power generation devices in the transportation field is also increasing. The complementary characteristics of FCs and HICEs in terms of power characteristics and high efficiency range make their application possible in high-power load scenarios such as rail transit. This paper focuses on the power system of intercity electric multiple unit (EMU) trains, using FC, HICE, and lithium batteries (LB) as power sources, and has conducted research on parameter matching and energy management for hybrid power systems (HPS). For parameter matching, the annual comprehensive cost is proposed to optimize the configuration of each source, achieving collaborative optimization of multiple objectives such as mass, volume, and operation and maintenance costs of the HPS. For energy management, a hierarchical control structure is built in this paper: In bottom-level control, based on the joint efficiency distribution of FC and HICE, the consumption coefficient fusion method is proposed to solve the power allocation between them; In top-level control, a new concept named battery cost state are proposed to measure the real-time cost of the energy stored in LB, and thus derived the cost state coefficient to accurately calculate the optimal output power of the hydrogen power system, thereby achieving the optimal power allocation between the hydrogen power system and the battery. Finally, according to the actual operating data, the Typhoon hardware in the loop platform is also used to verify the realtime control of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in both hydrogen consumption and low fluctuations.

AB Aims
   Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is a locally aggressive lesion that is difficult to treat as salvaging the joint can be associated with a high rate of local recurrence (LR). We evaluated the risk factors for tumour relapse after treatment of a GCTB of the limbs.
   Methods
   A total of 354 consecutive patients with a GCTB underwent joint salvage by curettage and reconstruction with bone graft and/or cement or en bloc resection. Patient, tumour, and treatment factors were analyzed for their impact on LR. Patients treated with denosumab were excluded.
   Results
   There were 53 LRs (15%) at a mean 30.5 months (5 to 116). LR was higher after curettage (18.4%) than after resection (4.6%; p = 0.008). Neither pathological fracture (p = 0.240), Campanacci grade (p = 0.734), soft-tissue extension (p = 0.297), or tumour size (p = 0.872) affected the risk of recurrence. Joint salvage was possible in 74% of patients overall (262/354), and 98% after curettage alone (262/267). Of 49 patients with LR after curettage, 44 (90%) underwent repeated curettage and joint salvage. For patients treated by curettage, only age less than 30 years (p = 0.042) and location in the distal radius (p = 0.043) predicted higher LR. The rate of LR did not differ whether cement or bone graft was used (p = 0.753), but may have been reduced by the use of hydrogen peroxide (p = 0.069). Complications occurred in 15.3% of cases (54/354) and did not differ by treatment.
   Conclusion
   Most patients with a GCTB can undergo successful joint salvage by aggressive curettage, even in the presence of a soft-tissue mass, pathological fracture, or a large lesion, with an 18.4% risk of local recurrence. However, 90% of local relapses after curettage can be treated by repeat joint salvage. Maximizing joint salvage is important to optimize long-term function since most patients with a GCTB are young adults. Younger patients and those with distal radius tumours treated with joint-sparing procedures have a higher rate of local relapse and may require more aggressive treatment and closer follow-up.

ID OXIDATION
AB Based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), infrared absorption spectra of porous silicon are calculated by using an ordered pore model, in which columns of silicon atoms are removed along the [001] direction and dangling bonds are initially saturated with hydrogen atoms. When these atoms on the pore surface are gradually replaced by oxygen ones, the ab-initio infrared absorption spectra reveal oxygen, hydroxyl, and coupled hydrogen- oxygen vibrational modes. In a parallel way, freestanding porous silicon samples were prepared by using electrochemical etching and they were further thermally oxidized in a dry oxygen ambient. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate the surface modifications caused by oxygen adsorption. In particular, the predicted hydroxyl and oxygen bound to the silicon pore surface are confirmed. Finally, a global analysis of measured transmittance spectra has been performed by means of a combined DFPT and thin-film optics approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DEMAND-SIDE; OPTIMIZATION
AB To improve the energy utilization rate and realize the low-carbon emission of a park integrated energy system (PIES), this paper proposes an optimal operation strategy for multiple PIESs. Firstly, the electrical power cooperative trading framework of multiple PIESs is constructed. Secondly, the hydrogen blending mechanism and carbon capture system and power-to-gas system joint operation model are introduced to establish the model of each PIES. Then, based on the Nash bargaining game theory, a multi-PIES cooperative trading and operation model with electrical power cooperative trading is constructed. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is used to solve the two subproblems. Finally, case studies analysis based on scene analysis is performed. The results show that the cooperative operation model reduces the total cost of a PIES more effectively compared with independent operation. Meanwhile, the efficient utilization and production of hydrogen are the keys to achieve carbon reduction and an efficiency increase in a PIES.

AB AZ91 magnesium alloys modified by Er and Ce are fabricated (referred to as AZErCe) and their stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviors are studied by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method in air, humid atmosphere with and without chloride. The addition of Er and Ce promotes the formation of Al3Er and Al11Ce3 phase and reduces both the size and the volume fraction of -phase. AZErCe possess improved corrosion resistance and passivation characteristic compared to AZ91 due to the reduced micro-galvanic corrosion and the more protective films. SSRT tests demonstrate that the joint addition of Er and Ce effectively improve the SCC resistance of AZ91 alloy. In particular, the representative fractography of AZErCe exhibits lesser effect of hydrogen embrittlement than AZ91. The improved SCC resistance of AZErCe can be ascribed to the presence of Er and Ce, which alleviate corrosion of Mg matrix and thus weaken the effect of hydrogen embrittlement on SCC resistance.

AB Pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes have been extensively studied for their ability to fine-tune PLP cofactor electronics to promote a wide array of chemistries. Neutron crystallography offers a straightforward approach to studying the electronic states of PLP and the electrostatics of enzyme active sites, responsible for the reaction specificities, by enabling direct visualization of hydrogen atom positions. Here we report a room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron structure of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) with pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP), the cofactor product of the first half reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. Between PMP N-SB and catalytic Lys258 N zeta amino groups an equally shared deuterium is observed in an apparent low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB). Density functional theory calculations were performed to provide further evidence of this LBHB interaction. The structural arrangement and the juxtaposition of PMP and Lys258, facilitated by the LBHB, suggests active site preorganization for the incoming ketoacid substrate that initiates the second half-reaction.

AB A joint experimental and numerical investigation of turbulent flame anchoring at externally heated walls is presented. The phenomenon has primarily been studied for laminar flames and micro-combustion while this study focuses on large-scale applications and elevated Reynolds number flows. Therefore, a novel burner design is developed and examined for a diverse set of operating conditions. Hydroxyl radical chemiluminescence measurements are employed to validate the numerical method. The numerical investigation evaluates the performance of various hydrogen/air kinetics, Reynolds-averaged turbulence models and the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) as a turbulence-chemistry interaction model. Simulation results show minor differences between detailed chemical mechanisms but pronounced deviations for a reduced kinetic. The baseline k-omega turbulence model is assessed to most accurately predict flame front position and shape. Universal applicability of EDC modeling constants is contradicted. Conclusively, the flame anchoring concept is considered a promising approach for pilot flames in continuous combustion devices. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Hydrogen bonding is a central concept in chemistry and biochemistry, and so it continues to attract intense study. Here, we examine hydrogen bonding in the H2S dimer, in comparison with the well-studied water dimer, in unprecedented detail. We record a mass-selected IR spectrum of the H2S dimer in superfluid helium nanodroplets. We are able to resolve a rotational substructure in each of the three distinct bands and, based on it, assign these to vibration-rotation-tunneling transitions of a single intramolecular vibration. With the use of high-level potential and dipole-moment surfaces we compute the vibration-rotation-tunneling dynamics and far-infrared spectrum with rigorous quantum methods. Intramolecular mode Vibrational Self-Consistent-Field and Configuration-Interaction calculations provide the frequencies and intensities of the four SH-stretch modes, with a focus on the most intense, the donor bound SH mode which yields the experimentally observed bands. We show that the intermolecular modes in the H2S dimer are substantially more delocalized and more strongly mixed than in the water dimer. The less directional nature of the hydrogen bonding can be quantified in terms of weaker electrostatic and more important dispersion interactions. The present study reconciles all previous spectroscopic data, and serves as a sensitive test for the potential and dipole-moment surfaces.
   Hydrogen bonding is a central concept in (bio)chemistry and has been intensively studied in the prototypical complex H2O-H2O. In this joint experimental/theoretical study, the authors find hydrogen bonding in H2S-H2S to be distinctly different.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovitis and progressive joint damage, primarily caused by oxidative injury from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypoxia in immune cells. Hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated potential in scavenging excess ROS and correcting redox imbalances, while oxygen supplementation can alleviate hypoxia, promoting inflammatory remission. This study introduces a novel FA-HA-PtPdCo-TiO2 (F-HPPCT) nano-system for targeted RA therapy. Comprising TiO2 quantum dots on PtPdCo polyhedra, decorated with folate-hyaluronic acid (FA-HA), F-HPPCT selectively targets inflammatory cells. Its metal-semiconductor heterostructure forms Schottky junctions that enhance electron transfer, enabling efficient hydrogen evolution and a photothermal effect under near-infrared light. Additionally, F-HPPCT mimics catalase activity, decomposing overexpressed H2O2 to relieve hypoxia and oxidative stress. The system synergistically scavenges ROS and replenishes oxygen, effectively reducing inflammation and oxidative damage. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments in arthritis models confirmed its efficacy, highlighting F-HPPCT's potential as a groundbreaking nanocatalyst for gas therapy in RA treatment.

AB The welding of dissimilar armor-grade steels is always challenging due to their carbon equivalent (CE) differences. In this investigation, dissimilar armor-grade steels (rolled homogenous armor (RHA) steels and ultra-high hard armor (UHA) steel) are welded using three electrodes, namely low hydrogen ferritic (LHF), austenitic stainless steel (ASS), and duplex stainless steel (DSS) by shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process. All the three joints were tested against the 7.62 x 54 mm armor-piercing (AP) projectile. The projectile was wholly stopped at the Weld Metal (WM). Three modes of failures were observed in WM (1) wear debris (WD), (2) wear debris + continuous cracks (WDCC), and (3) fine wear debris + microcracks (FWDMC). The joint fabricated using ASS electrode with the level of failure of WDCC performs better than other joints with the lowest area density of 70 kg/m(2) due to the high energy absorption capability of the austenite phase and higher strain hardening properties. At the interface, the martensitic band (MB) increases the hardness and has a vital role in determining ballistic resistance. The impact toughness and ductility of the weld metal play a significant role in deciding the ballistic performance more than hardness and strength properties.

AB Thick plate of 5083 aluminum alloy with 8 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm thicknesses are joined by double-side GMAW method. The influence of plate thickness on the welding stability, weld bead formation, porosity formation, microstructure and mechanical properties are investigated and compared. The results reveal that, with the increase of plate thickness, the stability of GMAW process, weld bead formation of the welded joints and the results of bending tests are similar. In larger plate thickness, more welding passes resulting in more source of hydrogen, larger specific surface area caused by thinner droplet, and the high solidification rate synergistically contribute to easier formation of porosity. With the increasing of plate thickness, higher peak temperatures of thermal cycles can lead to larger grain size. Besides, lower density of second-phase particles and more porosity of welded joint in larger plate thickness result in lower strength.

AB Brazing with nickel-based filler metals under vacuum is frequently applied for joining metals in applications that require high resistance to mechanical loads, corrosive environments and elevated temperatures. However, melting-point depressant elements in the filler can lead to brittle phases in the brazing seam, affecting crack initiation and propagation. This study investigated cylindrical butt joints of metastable austenitic AISI 304L, brazed with NiCrSiB-based fillers containing iron and molybdenum. Tensile, fatigue and corrosion tests were applied to identify the most promising filler for subsequent corrosion fatigue experiments in a self-developed test chamber. Results in air showed that fatigue performance close to AISI 304L can be achieved, when problematic Kirkendall voids and athermal brittle phases are avoided. Corrosion fatigue tests in aqueous environments with varying sodium chloride concentrations and elevated temperatures revealed that cracked chromium-rich borides in the diffusion-affected zone act as microgalvanic elements, accelerating corrosion fatigue via hydrogen embrittlement. At 80 degrees C, these mechanisms became widespread, leading to multiple crack initiations across the steel surface and not just in the brazing seam. Hence, this study highlights the complex interplay of microstructure, cyclic loading, and environmental effects, offering key insights into the failure mechanisms of vacuumbrazed joints under combined mechanical and corrosive stresses.

AB Cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), an enzyme associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, is an important endogenous regulator of inflammation. Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) is implicated in the immune response and inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential contribution of JMJD3 to endogenous CSE-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upregulated CSE and JMJD3 were identified in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) from RA patients as well as in the joints of arthritic mice. Knocking down CSE augmented inflammation in IL-1 beta-induced SFs by increasing JMJD3 expression. In addition, CSE-/- mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) developed severe joint inflammation and bone erosion. Conversely, overexpressing CSE inhibited JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 and was accompanied by reduced inflammation in IL-1 beta-treated SFs. Furthermore, JMJD3 silencing or the administration of the JMJD3 inhibitor GSK-J4 significantly decreased the inflammatory response in IL-1 beta-treated SFs, mainly by controlling the methylation status of H3K27me3 at the promoter of its target genes. GSK-J4 markedly attenuated the severity of arthritis in CIA mice. In conclusion, suppressing JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 is likely responsible for the ability of CSE to negatively modulate the inflammatory response and reduce the progression of RA.

AB Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic bonded joints with novel carbon nanotube (CNT) adhesive films were manufactured and tested under different aging conditions by varying the surfactant content added to enhance CNT dispersion. Single lap shear (SLS) tests were conducted in their initial state and after 1 and 2 months immersed in distilled water at 60 degrees C. In addition, their electrical response was measured in terms of the electrical resistance change through thickness. The lap shear strength showed an initial decrease due to plasticization of weak hydrogen bonds, and then a partial recovery due to secondary crosslinking. This plasticization effect was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry analysis with a decrease in the glass transition temperature. The electrical response varied with aging conditions, showing a higher plasticity region in the 1-month SLS joints, and a sharper increase in the case of the non-aged and 2-month-aged samples; these changes were more prevalent with increasing surfactant content. By adjusting the measured electrical data to simple theoretical calculations, it was possible to establish the first estimation of damage accumulation, which was higher in the case of non-aged and 2-month-aged samples, due to the presence of more prevalent brittle mechanisms for the CNT-doped joints.

AB The application of carbon-fiber-reinforcedthermoplastic(CFRTP)/metalhybrid structures is a vital step for realizing the lightweight designconcepts in aerospace. However, the CFRTP/metal hybrid structuresare usually not reliable enough in practical applications due to thehigh differences in chemical and physical properties between thesetwo materials. The current work provides a bottom-up strategy of introducingheteroatoms into CFRTP/metal interfaces to reconstruct the interfacialchemical structures and thus manufacture high-reliability hybrid structures.Based on the principle of utmost using reaction sites at metal surfaces,the heteroatoms of oxygen and hydrogen are specially designed andintroduced to the CFRTP/A6061-T6 (6061) interfaces by simple and greenplasma polymerization. The introduced oxygen and hydrogen heteroatomsreact with the aluminum and oxygen of the oxidation film at 6061 surfacesto produce great interfacial Al-O covalencies and hydrogenbonds. The reconstructing interfacial chemical structures strengthenthe joint strength of CFRTP/6061 hybrid structures from 8.82 to 23.97MPa. Our heteroatom introduction strategy is expected to get a freshinsight into the interfacial design concept and has several importantimplications for the future application of high-reliability CFRTP/metalhybrid structures.

AB The effect of stress concentration on crack initiation and propagation during stress corrosion cracking of carbon steel in alternate wet and dry marine condition was studied by constant load tensile and microelectrochemical test. Results showed that the notch front does not crack but pitting occurs in the corrosion process under loadfree condition. Under the loading condition, the anodic dissolution (AD) near the notch gradually intensified, and this effect become severer with increasing load. The local environment of the load-induced rapid AD and hydrogen evolution (HE) can lead to crack initiation, indicating that the joint action of AD and HE is the main SCC mechanism.

AB Titanium-salalen complexes have recently solved a long-standing problem in homogeneous epoxidation catalysis by enabling the selective catalytic epoxidation of terminal, nonconjugated olefins with hydrogen peroxide. In this work, we disclose the mechanism of this intriguing catalyst system, based on XRD analyses, kinetic studies, and NMR elucidation of intermediate structures, complemented by DFT computations. Titanium-salalen catalysts are typically prepared/stored as bis-mu-oxo or mu-oxo-mu-peroxo dimers. Under reaction conditions, while the mu-oxo bridged catalyst dimers remain intact, the epoxidation occurs through an octahedral, yet altered, coordination geometry of the homochiral monomeric subunits. This catalytically active coordination mode is accessed by a slow pre-equilibrium, involving uptake of hydrogen peroxide, and subsequent rearrangement of the coordination sphere of the dinuclear complex. This configuration allows a three-pronged electrophilic activation of hydrogen peroxide, which enables oxygen transfer by the joint action of (i) the Lewis acidic titanium center, (ii) H-bond donation by the ligand's NH, and (iii) mu-chalcogen interaction with the ligand's pentafluorophenyl moieties. This efficient activation of H2O2 by a dinuclear site parallels recent findings on the active sites of the industrial heterogeneous titanium silicalite TS-1 catalyst.

AB The pathological mechanisms and treatments of osteoarthritis (OA) are critical topics in medical research. This paper reviews the regulatory mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in OA and the therapeutic potential of H2S donors. The review highlights the importance of changes in the endogenous H2S pathway in OA development and systematically elaborates on the role of H2S as a third gaseous transmitter that regulates inflammation, oxidative stress, and pain associated with OA. It also explains how H2S can lessen bone and joint inflammation by inhibiting leukocyte adhesion and migration, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators, and impeding the activation of key inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Additionally, H2S is shown to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and to modulate Nrf2, NF-kappa B, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways, thereby decreasing oxidative stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Moreover, H2S alleviates bone and joint pain through the activation of Kv7, K-ATP, and Nrf2/HO-1-NQO1 pathways. Recent developments have produced a variety of H2S donors, including sustained-release H2S donors, natural H2S donors, and synthetic H2S donors. Understanding the role of H2S in OA can lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets, while innovative H2S donors offer promising new treatments for patients with OA.

AB Hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine are antiseptics that are commonly added to irrigants to either prevent or treat infection. There are little clinical data available that demonstrate efficacy of adding antiseptics to irrigants in the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection after biofilm establishment. The objective of the study was to assess the bactericidal activity of the antiseptics on S. aureus planktonic and biofilm. For planktonic irrigation, S. aureus was exposed to different concentrations of antiseptics. S. aureus biofilm was developed by submerging a Kirschner wire into normalized bacteria and allowing it to grow for forty-eight hours. The Kirschner wire was then treated with irrigation solutions and plated for CFU analysis. Hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine were bactericidal against planktonic bacteria with over a 3 log reduction (p < 0.0001). Unlike cefazolin, the antiseptics were not bactericidal (less than 3 log reduction) against biofilm bacteria but did have a statistical reduction in biofilm as compared to the initial time point (p < 0.0001). As compared to cefazolin treatment alone, the addition of hydrogen peroxide or povidone-iodine to cefazolin treatment only additionally reduced the biofilm burden by less than 1 log. The antiseptics demonstrated bactericidal properties with planktonic S. aureus; however, when used to irrigate S. aureus biofilms, these antiseptics were unable to decrease biofilm mass below a 3 log reduction, suggesting that S. aureus biofilm has a tolerance to antiseptics. This information should be considered when considering antibiotic tolerance in established S. aureus biofilm treatment.

AB The adsorption behavior of Pb(OH)(+) on the basal octahedral (001) surface of kaolinite has been investigated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) of density functional theory with periodic slab models, where the water environment was considered. The coordination geometry, coordination number, preferred adsorption position, and adsorption type were examined, with binding energy estimated. All the monodentate and bidentate complexes exhibited hemi-directed geometry with coordination numbers of 3-5. Site of "O-u" with "up" hydrogen was more favorable for monodentate complex than site of "O-l" with "lying" hydrogen. Monodentate complexation of "O-u" site with a high binding energy of -182.60 kJ center dot mol(-1) should be the most preferred adsorption mode, while bidentate complexation on "OuOl" site of single Al center was also probable. The stability of adsorption complex was found closely related to the hydrogen bonding interactions between surface O-l and H in aqua ligands of Pb(II). Mulliken population and density of states analyses showed that coupling of Pb 6p with the antibonding Pb 6s-O 2p states was the primary orbital interaction between Pb(II) and the surface oxygen. Hydrogen complexation occupied a much large proportion in the joint coordination structure of bidentate complex, where bonding state filling predominated for the Pb-O-I interaction.

AB In subsea oil and gas systems, microalloyed steel linepipes are welded to low alloy steel (e.g. 8630) forgings using dissimilar fillers, such as alloy 625. Post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) is necessary to temper the heat affected zone (HAZ) and relieve residual stresses. During PWHT, carbon diffuses from the forging into the weld, where it is able to form critical new phases while creating a carbon depleted region within the HAZ. Although the phases that form within the weld metal are well documented, the extent of carbon diffusion remained unexplored. To tackle the problem, a combined experimental and modelling approach has been adopted. DICTRA simulations were employed in calculation of elemental diffusion, while electron microscopy has been used to verify phase formation and the extent of carbon diffusion. The results reported herein indicate that it is possible to modify the susceptibility of these joints to hydrogen embrittlement.

AB A new approach for biomass liquefaction was developed and evaluated in a joint research project. Focus of the project, called FEBio@H2O, lies on a two-step hydrothermal conversion. Within step 1, the input biomass is converted employing a hydrothermal degradation without added catalyst or by homogeneous catalysis. Within step 2, the hydrogen accepting products of step 1, e.g., levulinic acid (LA) are upgraded by a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation with hydrogen donor substances, e.g., formic acid (FA). As a result, components with an even lower oxygen content in comparison to step 1 products are formed; as an example, gamma-valerolactone (GVL) can be named. Therefore, the products are more stable and contained less oxygen as requested for a possible application as liquid fuel. As a hydrothermal process, FEBio@H2O is especially suitable for highly water-containing feedstock. The evaluation involves hydrothermal conversion tests with model substances, degradation of real biomasses, transfer hydrogenation or hydrogenation with hydrogen donor of model substances and real products of step 1, catalyst selection and further development, investigation of the influence of reactor design, the experimental test of the whole process chain, and process assessment.

AB The epoxy adhesive-galvanized steel adhesive structure has been widely used in various industrial fields, but achieving high bonding strength and corrosion resistance is a challenge. This study examined the impact of surface oxides on the interfacial bonding performance of two types of galvanized steel with Zn-Al or Zn-Al-Mg coatings. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the Zn-Al coating was covered by ZnO and Al2O3, while MgO was additionally found on the Zn-Al-Mg coating. Both coatings exhibited excellent adhesion in dry environments, but after 21 days of water soaking, the Zn-Al-Mg joint demonstrated better corrosion resistance than the Zn-Al joint. Numerical simulations revealed that metallic oxides of ZnO, Al2O3, and MgO had different adsorption preferences for the main components of the adhesive. The adhesion stress at the coating-adhesive interface was mainly due to hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, and the theoretical adhesion stress of MgO adhesive system was higher than that of ZnO and Al2O3. The corrosion resistance of the Zn-Al-Mg adhesive interface was mainly due to the stronger corrosion resistance of the coating itself, and the lower water-related hydrogen bond content at the MgO adhesive interface. Understanding these bonding mechanisms can lead to the development of improved adhesive-galvanized steel structures with enhanced corrosion resistance.

AB The lack of self-recovery features and mechanical toughness has fundamentally limited the practical applications of ionic single-network hydrogels. Due to strong ionic interactions with Zr4+ cation crosslinkers, intramolecular crosslinking nodes are found to evolve via the folding of alginate segments, revolutionizing alginate hydrogels with substantial self-recovery capability and enhanced mechanical strength. Although being restricted by likecharge repulsion still, this new crosslinking mechanism triples the reachable tensile strain of alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, and largely improves self-recovery efficiency. As the gold nanoparticles with adsorbed alginate segments are further introduced as nanoparticulate crosslinking joints, nanoparticle size and weight ratios emerge as new parameters of reached plateau modules and, thus, effective crosslinking density. The stretching-induced conformation alteration and stripping of adsorbed alginate segments are surprisingly associated with the detachment of capping ligands from gold nanoparticles instead of the cleavage of hydrogen bonding between ligands and alginates. As a result, the strong interactions between capping ligands and nanoparticles significantly stimulate the re-adsorption of stripped alginate segments on nanoparticles, leading to the extraordinary 90 % self-recovery of mechanical strength within 5 min with much promoted tensile strength and energy dissipation. For achieved self-recovery efficiency, adjustable partial destruction of intramolecular nodes and nanoparticulate crosslinking joints have been unveiled essential. Hence, new concepts regarding the evolution and partial destruction of newly identified crosslinking joints have been delivered, which together with disclosed influential factors, including the size and capping ligands of crosslinking joints, should stimulate innovative approaches to promote the use of ionic hydrogels.

AB Rapid detection technology of the carburization of Fe-Cr-Ni high-temperature heat-resistant alloys in the ethylene cracking furnace and the hydrogen conversion furnace is in great need to prevent industrial accident. This paper implemented the GMRI-I carburizing detector to test the degree of carburization of 25Cr35NiNb+ microalloy inlet tube and 35Cr45NiNb+ microalloy outlet tube of the ethylene cracking furnace after service as well as the reinforced joint made of UNS N08810 from the hydrogen-producing reformer. In conjunction with the results of the low-power acid corrosion test, a rapid detection method for the degree of carburization was proposed. Based on the experimental results of the carburizing detector and the laboratory test data, the carburization degree test curve of the above three alloys based on the magnetic field strength has been established. The detection accuracy was circa. 5% and the error was 610%, which is convenient for guiding the use and replacement of Fe-Cr-Ni high-temperature heat-resistant alloy materials for ethylene cracking furnace and hydrogen conversion furnace, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation of the device.

AB Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is a promising solution for mitigating the instability of clean energy generation. However, the hydrogen injection/extraction process may activate potential faults surrounding the caverns, jeopardizing the service safety of the lining structures. In this study, a novel polymeric sealing layer was developed and tested for UHES, to replace the traditional steel lining. A numerical model of fault activation was established to analyze the mechanical response of the lining structures under various parameters, such as injection/extraction operation parameters, fault characteristics, and concrete lining forms. Results show that the stress level of the concrete lining is directly related to the number of hydrogen injection/extraction cycles, fault angle, and magnitude, while it diminishes with increasing fault distance. The flexible joint fillers could disperse the circumferential stress and absorb energy continuously during fault activation, resulting in lower stress levels and damage to segmental concrete lining, compared with integral concrete lining. The sealing layer, protected by the concrete lining, experiences lower stress fluctuations during fault activation. Additionally, the results obtained show that a certain distance threshold for fault-induced damage to the concrete lining was identified, beyond which fault activation no longer triggers damage. The distance threshold was tentatively determined to be 20 m.

AB Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of a stainless steel 308L-316L weld joint in primary water of pressurized water reactor was investigated. Stress corrosion crack growth in the HAZ was observed in off-normal primary water chemistry with dissolved oxygen, but not in normal primary water chemistry with dissolved hydrogen. This suggests that it is unlikely a stress corrosion crack propagating in the HAZ could reach the fusion boundary and penetrate into the weld metal under normal primary water chemistry conditions. Microstructure analysis of the crack tip suggests that the SCC follows the slip-oxidation mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-APS) and gamma-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-GPS) single or bilayer silane film was produced to improve the tensile property of laser-welded 304 stainless steel/CFRTP joint in this work. The bonding mechanism at joint interface was investigated through experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Si-O-Fe covalent bonds were formed between steel and different silane films. Hydrogen bonds were induced at the interfaces of silane coating/polymer sides. The binding energy calculation results suggested that the binding between gamma-APS silane coupling agent and steel was more stable than that of gamma-GPS and steel. The binding energy of -3.37 eV between amino group in gamma-APS and carbonyl group in CFRTP was greater than the binding energy of -4.84 eV between epoxy group in gamma-GPS and amide group in CFRTP, which indicated stronger interaction was obtained between gamma-GPS and polymer compared to the interaction between gamma-APS and polymer. The bilayer silane coating could combine the dominant functional groups of silane monolayer film to obtain stable bonding on both metal side and CFRTP side. Moreover, compared with silane single film, longer silane oligomer molecular chain length was provided by bilayer silane film, resulting in more entanglement sites between silane film and CFRTP and the increased joint mechanical property. The steel/CFRTP hybrid joint reached maximum tensile shear strength of 17.2 MPa, which was further increased by 115.0% and 79.2% than that obtained by gamma-APS and gamma-GPS silane single coating, respectively.

AB We tested the influence of estrogen on coronary resistance regulation by modulating nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in female rats. For this, estrogen levels were manipulated and the hearts were immediately excised and perfused at a constant flow using a Langendorff's apparatus. Higher estrogen levels were associated with a lower coronary resistance, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, and higher levels of H2O2. When oxide nitric synthase blockade by L-NAME was performed, no significant changes were found in coronary resistance of ovariectomized rats. Additionally, we found an inverse association between NO levels and catalase activity. Taken together, our data suggest that, in the absence of estrogen influence and, therefore, reduced NO bioavailability, coronary resistance regulation seems to be more dependent on the H2O2 that is maintained at low levels by increased catalase activity.

AB This paper addresses public acceptance of a proposed sub-regional, hydrogen-electric, aviation service reporting initial empirical evidence from the UK HEART project. The objective was to assess public acceptance of a wide range of service features, including hydrogen power, electric motors, and pilot assistance automation, in the context of an ongoing realisable commercial plan. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection instruments were leveraged, including focus groups and stakeholder interviews, as well as the questionnaire-based Scottish National survey, coupled with the advanced discrete-choice modelling of the data. The results from each method are presented, compared, and contrasted, focusing on the strength, reliability, and validity of the data to generate insights into public acceptance. The findings suggest that public concerns were tempered by an incomplete understanding of the technology but were interpretable in terms of key service elements. Respondents' concerns and opinions centred around hydrogen as a fuel, single-pilot automation, safety and security, disability and inclusion, environmental impact, and the perceived usefulness of novel service features such as terminal design, automation, and sustainability. The latter findings were interpreted under a joint framework of technology acceptance theory and the diffusion of innovation. From this, we drew key insights, which were presented alongside a discussion of the results.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly erodes joints and surrounding tissues, and if it is not treated in time, it can cause joint deformities and loss of function. S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC) is an excellent endogenous hydrogen sulfide donor which can relieve the symptoms of RA through the promotion of H2S release via the CSE/H2S pathway in vivo. However, the instant release of H2S in vivo could potentially limit its further clinical use. To solve this problem, in this study, a SPRC-loaded poly(lactic acid) (PLA) microsphere (SPRC@PLA) was prepared, which could release SPRC in vitro in a sustained manner, and further promote sustained in vivo H2S release. Furthermore, its therapeutical effect on RA in rats was also studied. A spherical-like SPRC@PLA was successfully prepared with a diameter of approximately 31.61 mu m, yielding rate of 50.66%, loading efficiency of 6.10% and encapsulation efficiency of 52.71%. The SPRC@PLA showed significant prolonged in vitro SPRC release, to 4 days, and additionally, an in vivo H2S release around 3 days could also be observed. In addition, a better therapeutical effect and prolonged administration interval toward RA rats was also observed in the SPRC@PLA group.

AB With the urbanization construction and the advancement of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, urban energy systems are characterized by coupling multi-energy networks and a high pro-portion of renewable energy. Urban energy systems need to improve the quality of energy use, as well as to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. Inter-seasonal heat technology has satisfactory engineering application prospects in promoting renewable energy consumption and the energy supply of urban multi-energy systems. Considering inter-seasonal heat storage and electric hydrogen production, a joint optimization method of planning and operation is proposed for the urban multi-energy flow system. First, the operation framework of inter-seasonal heat storage and electric hydrogen production system is established, which clarifies the energy flow of the urban multi-energy system. Secondly, aiming at the goals of minimizing the equipment's annual investment cost and the multi-energy system annual operation cost, combined with the time series period division method, a planning operation model has been established considering multi-objectives. Through case study, it is shown that the proposed model can promote the renewable energy consumption and reduce the operation cost of the whole system.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reactive air brazing has been widely used in fabricating solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell (SOFC/SOEC) stacks. However, the conventional Ag-CuO braze can lead to (I) over oxidation at the steel interconnect interface caused by its adverse reactions with the CuO and (II) many voids caused by the hydrogen-induced decomposition of CuO. The present work demonstrates that the Ag particle interlayer can be used to join yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes to AISI 441 interconnect in air instead of Ag-CuO braze. Reliable joining between YSZ and AISI 441 can be realized at 920 degrees C. A dense and thin oxide layer (~2 mu m) is formed at the AISI 441 interface. Additionally, an interatomic joining at the YSZ/Ag interface was observed by TEM. Obtained joints displayed a shear strength of ~86.1 MPa, 161% higher than that of the joints brazed by Ag-CuO braze (~33 MPa). After aging in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres (800 degrees C/300 h), joints remained tight and dense, indicating a better aging performance. This technique eliminates the CuO-induced issues, which may extend lifetimes for SOFC/SOEC stacks and other ceramic/metal joining applications.

AB To effectively improve the absorption capacity of the integrated energy system to clean energy, reduce the carbon emissions of the system, and improve the economic benefits of the system, this paper constructs a comprehensive energy system model that includes electricity to hydrogen and hydrogen to gas and introduces the carbon trading mechanism, the green certificate trading mechanism, and the response mechanism to the load demand. Set different scenarios for example analysis, and solve the model through the CPLEX solver. The results show that the operation strategy of the integrated energy system considering demand response under the carbon green certificate joint trading mechanism performs best, reducing the total cost of the system by 65.8% and the carbon emissions by 23.1%, which can provide a strong reference and guidance for the low-carbon economy operation of the integrated energy system.

AB In 2018, Mishik Airazatovich Kazaryan received the highest award of the International Association for Alternative Energy and Ecology Order of Antoine de Saint-Exupe = ry "For Improving the Quality of Life on the Planet of People" (IAAEE) on nominating the Award Committee of the Editorial Board of the International Scientific Journal for Alternative Energy and Ecology (ISJAEE). The award was given for his outstanding contribution to development of alternative energetics and ecology. M.A. Kazaryan's prominent contribution to the development of alternative energetics and ecology is based on his pioneering works in the field of development of methods for producing hydrogen as environmentally friendly safe fuel, as well as works in the field of processing organic compounds by various physical methods. As a part of joint research with colleagues from Lebedev Physical Institute of RAS (LPI), M.A. Kazaryan participated in creation of new methods for producing hydrogen from various chemical compounds. The method of conversion of liquid-phase compounds in plasma discharges under the influence of intensive ultrasonic cavitation occupies a special place. In the course of these works, it is shown that low-temperature plasma initiated in liquid-phase media in discharge between electrodes is able to effectively decompose hydrogen containing molecules of organic compounds and form gaseous products where the part of hydrogen is more than 90%. Estimations of energy efficiency calculated taking into account hydrogen combustion heat and initial substances, as well as electricity costs, showed an efficiency level of about 60-70% in depending on the composition of the starting mixture. Another notable contribution of M.A. Kazaryan to the development of alternative energetics was the work on the optimization and justification of technological and structural parameters of energy discharge devices based on high-voltage pulse-periodic discharge for creating a reactor for plasmachemical processing of polymer wastes into hydrogen and other valuable compounds.

AB The correlations of joint detection of 22 vaginal microbes with routine examination results of vaginal secretions and assisted reproductive outcomes were investigated. There were 37 samples with abnormal vaginal microecology in 107 vaginal secretion samples. The top 5 detection rates of microorganisms were Ureaplasma urealyticum (73.83%), Prevotella sp. (70.09%), Gardnerella vaginalis (53.27%), L. crispatus (52.34%) and L. inerts (51.40%). When the levels of Bacillus and hydrogen peroxide in vaginal secretions decreased or pH increased, the abnormal rates of vaginal microecology increased significantly (P < 0.01). The clinical pregnancy rate (53.66%, 22/41) in the women with normal vaginal microecology was higher than that (37.5%, 9/ 24) with abnormal vaginal microecology. In conclusions, the joint detection of 22 vaginal microbes can quickly and effectively determine whether the vaginal microecology is normal or not. The evaluation of vaginal microecology may be valuable in predicting the assisted reproductive outcomes of infertile women.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In the fusion reactor advanced blanket concepts, considerable attention has always been directed towards the materials employed for the coolants/breeders because the blanket components will be exposed to a harsh environment, including neutron/gamma-ray irradiation and high-temperature tritium breeders. Multifunctional ceramic coatings have been studied to reduce hydrogen isotope permeation, electrical conductivity, and corrosion of structural materials. For the sustainable development of a liquid blanket system, the coatings require not only permeation reduction but also resistance to irradiation damage, which is invisible, accumulative, and can be able to unexpected failure within a short period. In this study, the synergistic corrosion mechanisms of Li-Pb compatibility for the blanket materials were investigated through Li-Pb exposure tests under gamma-ray irradiation. A liquid-phase method and a hot-isostatic pressing were applied for the formation of ceramic-iron joint coatings on the inner wall of a steel tube. In static and flowing Li-Pb exposure tests under gamma-ray irradiation, the joint coatings and multi-layer coatings indicated superior corrosion resistance.

AB Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.

AB When for steel liners of pressure tunnels and shafts high-strength steels are used, welded joints are subject to the risk of hydrogen induced cold-cracking in the base material. Longitudinal butt welded joints are critical regions as they are loaded transversely. For an accurate engineering fatigue and fracture assessment, solutions for stress intensity factors (SIF) are required, considering the weld shape and the global behavior of the liner (i.e., geometrical imperfections and interaction with surrounding concrete and rock). In this study, SIF for axial semi-elliptical surface cracks and embedded elliptical cracks at longitudinal butt welded joints of steel liners are studied by means of the finite element method. At first the applicability of published parametric equations for SIF of elliptical cracks in plates is validated. Then the influence of the weld shape is assessed through a systematic parametric study. It is shown that the weld profile has a significant influence on SIF for semi-elliptical surface cracks while it has no significant influence on SIF for embedded elliptical cracks within the studied range of relative crack depth. Finally, a new parametric equation is proposed to estimate the weld shape correction factor for semi-elliptical surface cracks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of planar laminar premixed ammonia/hydrogen/air flames are conducted fora wide range of equivalence ratios, hydrogen (H2) fractions in the fuel blend, pressures, and unburned temperatures to study intrinsic flame instabilities (IFIs) in the linear regime. For stoichiometric and lean mixtures at ambient conditions, a non-monotonic behavior of thermo-diffusive instabilities with increasing H2 fraction is observed. Strongest instabilities occur for molar H2 fractions of 40%. The analysis shows that this behavior is linked to the joint effect of variations of the effective Lewis number and Zeldovich number. IFIs in ammonia/hydrogen blends further show a non-monotonic trend with respect to pressure, which is found to be linked to the chemistry of the hydroperoxyl radical HO2. The addition of NH3 opens new reaction pathways for the consumption of HO2 resulting in a chain carrying behavior in contrast to its chain terminating nature in pure H2/air flames. Theoretically derived dispersion relations can predict the non-monotonic behavior for lean conditions. However, these are found to be sensitive to the different methods for evaluating the Zeldovich number available in the literature. The novelty of this research is the systematic identification and explanation of a non-monotonic behavior of intrinsic flame instabilities IFIs in ammonia/hydrogen/air (NH3/H2/air) flames concerning the hydrogen content in the fuel and the pressure. To the author's knowledge, this study presents the largest parametric study for linear stability analyses of NH3/H2/air flames. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis to the Zeldovich number is proposed to link the macroscopic effect of IFIs to the microscopic effects of chemistry. In light of possible applications of NH3 as zero-carbon fuel, this study is significant because the fundamental understanding of IFIs in NH3/H2/air flames is key for the analysis and modeling of such flames.

AB In recent years, hydrogen-based multi-energy systems (HMESs) have received wide attention. However, existing works on the optimal operation of HMESs neglect building thermal dynamics, which means that the flexibility of thermal loads can not be utilized for reducing system operation cost. In this paper, we investigate an optimal operation problem of an HMES with the consideration of building thermal dynamics. Specifically, we first formulate an expected operational cost minimization problem related to an HMES. Due to the existence of uncertain parameters, inexplicit building thermal dynamics models, spatially and temporally coupled operational constraints, and nonlinear constraints, it is challenging to solve the formulated problem. Then, we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on model-based optimization and data-driven based learning. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is summarized as follows: (1) transforming the long-term cost minimization problem into several single-slot subproblems using Lyapunov optimization techniques; (2) dividing each single-slot subproblem into two parts according to the availability of model information; (3) solving one part based on convex optimization and solving another part using multi-agent attention-based deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation results based on real-world traces show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB A new method for joint processing of experimental data from various laboratories based on their approximation by the generalized Arrhenius law is proposed. The method is based on the construction of a system of functions that are orthogonal on a given set of points with arbitrary weights. As a result, the confidence intervals of the approximation coefficients can be estimated and the number of terms required for the approximation can be correctly determined. The performance of the method is demonstrated as applied to reactions of hydrogen combustion in air that are important at T < 1000 K. High accuracy of reaction rate approximation is achieved.

AB By applying the enzyme catalase, our study on hyaluronan degradation confirms the generation of hydrogen peroxide using the Weissberger biogenic oxidative system (WBOS), which is composed of ascorbate and cupric ions. Dynamic viscosities of hyaluronan (HA) solutions influenced by WBOS in the absence and presence of catalase were analysed by rotational viscometry. Molar masses of HAs were determined by size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser-light scattering. Our results show that catalase dose-dependently inhibited the degradation of HA macromolecules, which presumably confirms the generation of H2O2 in the reaction system. This has implications in range of biomedical applications such as arthritic joint treatment, tissue engineering, ocular and cosmetic surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main intent of the current research was to appraise if combined application of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, 0.2 mM) and silicon (Si 2.0 mM) could improve tolerance of tomato plants to arsenic (As as sodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate, 0.2 mM) stress. Plant growth, chlorophylls (Chl), PSII maximum efficiency (Fv/Fm), H2S concentration and L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity were found to be suppressed, but leaf and root As, leaf proline content, phytochelatins, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 as well as the activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) increased under As stress. H2S and Si supplied together or alone enhanced the concentrations of key antioxidant biomolecules such as ascorbic acid, and reduced glutathione and the activities of key antioxidant system enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). In comparison with individual application of H2S or Si, the joint supplementation of both had better effect in improving growth and key biochemical processes, and reducing tissue As content, suggesting a putative collaborative role of both molecules in improving tolerance to As-toxicity in tomato plants.

AB Joint disorders seriously affect daily life. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a type of chronic autoimmune disorder, causes recession for range of motion (ROM) and joint function loss. Monitoring and recording ROM is regarded as an efficient way for assisting in RA diagnosis at an early stage. Here, a multi-function hydrogel-based sensor was developed to monitor RA motion. With an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was prepared from self-crosslinked the poly (N-Hydroxyethyl acrylamide-co-Acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PHA) network with conductive polymers PEDOT:PSS and Zinc ions, this conductive hydrogel (PHAC) was able to achieve stretchable, sensitive, adhesive and anti-bacterial properties. The hydrogen bonding and ion interaction present in hydrogel network enable PHAC with high stretchable (similar to 5000 % strain), strong adhesion to connection (61.4 kPa on copper), high conductivity (208.96 mS.cm(-1)), fast self-healing (recovery to 40 % stretchable properties in 10 min) and excellent anti-bacterial behavior. After combining this sensor element with customized printed circuit board (PCB) and detachable battery, the RA monitor system demonstrated the real-time recording, accurate detection of ROM, and long-time stability of signal transmission. This line of research work sheds light on stretchable, sensitive, adhesive, self-healable, anti-bacterial and wireless soft sensors with potential applications in human joint monitoring, personal healthcare diagnosis, and soft robots.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and the leading cause of disability in elderly individuals. Despite rapid advances in imaging techniques, early OA diagnosis remains a clinical challenge. In the present study, the feasibility of early OA diagnosis was explored via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with aquaphotomics. Synovial fluid samples from 65 cases of OA categorized as mild, moderate, and severe according to the Kellgren and Lawrence classification criteria were analyzed via NIRS. The 1st overtone of water (1300-1600 nm) was considered as the research object for an aquaphotomics model, and aquagrams of the mild, moderate, and severe OA cases were generated using 12 water absorption patterns for early OA diagnosis.The aquaphotomics results exhibited clear differences in the region of 1300-1500 nm, and the number of hydrogen bonds of different water species (1412,1424, 1482, and 1496 nm) evidently correlated with OA occurrence and development. With OA progression, the absorption intensity of water molecules without hydrogen bonds (1412 nm/1424 nm) became stronger, while the absorption intensity of water molecules with four hydrogen bonds (1482 nm/1496 nm) decreased.These results together reveal that the established accurate and rapid early OA diagnosis model based on NIRS combined with aquaphotomics is effective and feasible, and that the number of hydrogen bonds can be used as a biomarker for early OA diagnosis.

SO RSC ADVANCES

DT Article
AB Ionogels have attracted tremendous interest for flexible electronics due to their excellent deformability, conductivity, and environmental stability. However, most ionogels suffer from low strength and poor toughness, which limit their practical applications. This article presents a strategy for fabricating ionogels with high toughness by constructing high-density hydrogen bonds within their microstructure. The ionogels exhibit a maximum fracture strength of 11.44 MPa, and can sustain a fracture strain of 506%. They also demonstrate a fracture energy of 27.29 MJ m-3 and offer a wide range of mechanical property adjustments (fracture stress from 0.3 to 11.44 MPa, fracture strain from 506% to 1050%). Strain sensors assembled with ionogels demonstrate exceptional sensing performance and enable motion detection of human joints. This study provides a new approach for achieving strong and tough ionogel design used for high-performance flexible electronic applications.
   In this paper, ionogels with high mechanical properties were prepared by constructing a high-density hydrogen bond crosslinking network. The ionogel also has excellent transparency, environmental stability, adhesion and shape memory ability.

AB Conductive hydrogel-based epidermal strain sensors can generate repeatable electrical changes upon mechanical deformations for indication of the skin's physiological condition. However, this remains challenging for many conductive hydrogel sensors due to biomechanical mismatch with skin tissues and an unstable resistance variation response, resulting in non-conformable deformations with the epidermis and dermis, and consequently generating inaccurate monitoring of human movements. Herein, a conductive hydrogel that highly matches the skin is fabricated from dynamically hydrogen-bonded nanocrystallites of polydopamine-modified reduced graphene oxide (PDA-rGO) nanosheets composited with polyvinyl alcohol, namely the PDA-rGO/PVA hydrogel. PDA-rGO provides a large number of dynamic hydrogen-bonding interactions in the hydrogel, resulting in a skin-matching modulus (78 kPa) and stretchability. Moreover, the resultant hydrogel possesses excellent cytocompatibility and conductivity (0.87 S m(-1)), high sensitivity (gauge factor of compression: 20) at low strain and outstanding linearity at high strain as well as a stable resistance variation response. These desirable properties enable the application of the PDA-rGO/PVA hydrogel as a skin-friendly wearable sensor for real-time and accurate detection of both large-scale joint movements and tiny physiological signals, including the bending and relaxing of fingers, the wrist, elbow and knee joints, and wrist pulse and swallowing. Moreover, this hydrogel is integrated into a 2D sensor array that monitors strains or pressures in two dimensions, which is promising for electronic skin, biosensors, human-machine interfaces, and wearable electronic devices.

AB A joint theoretical and experimental study is reported to systematically explore over a library of transition metal-silicon intermetallics for understanding silicon-controlled active site motifs and discovering hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts. On the one hand, every low-index surface termination of 115 transition metal (M)-silicon (Si) intermetallics is enumerated, followed by cataloging of stable adsorption sites and prediction of catalytic activities on the main exposed facets. It is theoretically found that silicon atoms in silicon-rich structures (especially MSi2 and MSi) show a strong site-isolating effect, which can eliminate M-M-M hollow and M-M bridge sites with too strong hydrogen-binding ability and thereby provide great opportunities for the exposure of novel highly active sites (e.g., M-top and Si-related sites). On the other hand, solid-state redox reactions are developed to synthesize a set of 24 silicides containing 5 MSi, 13 MSi2, and 6 others, most of which are phase-pure samples. The experimental studies demonstrate that too rich silicon content in silicides (e.g., MSi2) leads to adverse effects, such as the formation of amorphous SiOx layers on the silicide surface, masking the presence of active sites during electrocatalysis. Finally, 5 MSi (M = Rh, Pd, Pt, Ru, Ir) as highly active hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts are identified.

AB The compound 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) is a product of skin oil ozonolysis and is of significance in understanding the role of human occupants in the indoor environment. We present a joint computational and experimental study investigating the adsorption of 6-MHO on two model indoor relevant surfaces, SiO2, a model for a glass window, and TiO2, a component of paint and self-cleaning surfaces. Our classical force field-based molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and FTIR absorption spectra indicate 6-MHO can adsorb on to both of these surfaces via hydrogen and pi-hydrogen bonds and is quite stable due to the linear geometry of 6-MHO. Detailed analysis of 6-MHO on the SiO2 surface shows that relative humidity does not impact surface adsorption and adsorbed water does not displace 6-MHO from the hydroxylated SiO2 surface. Additionally, the desorption kinetics of 6-MHO from the hydroxylated SiO2 surface is compared to other compounds found in indoor environments and 6-MHO is shown to desorb with a first order rate constant that is approximately four times slower than that of limonene, but six times faster than that of carvone. In addition, our joint results indicate 6-MHO forms a stronger interaction with the TiO2 surface compared to the SiO2 surface. This study suggests that skin oil ozonolysis products can partition to indoor surfaces leading to the formation of organic films.

AB Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is an age-related progressive degenerative joint disease, which is featured with pain, joint deformity, and disability. Accumulating evidence indicated oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of KOA. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound with significant antioxidant activity among various diseases while catalase (CAT) is an enzyme degrading hydrogen peroxide in treating oxidative diseases. We previously showed that the expression of CAT was low in cartilage. However, the combination of curcumin and CAT in KOA is still elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of curcumin and CAT has the potential to inhibit the IL1 beta-induced chondrocyte apoptosis without cytotoxicity in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that the synergistic application curcumin and CAT not only promotes curcumin's regulation of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway to enhance antioxidant enzyme expression to remove superoxide radicals, but also CAT can further remove downstream hydrogen peroxide which enhances the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vivo, studies revealed that combination of curcumin and catalase could better inhibit oxidative stress-induced chondrocyte injury by promoting the expression of ROS scavenging enzymes. In sum, the combination of curcumin and catalase can be used to treat KOA. Thus, combination of curcumin and catalase may act as a novel therapeutic agent to manage KOA and our research gives a rationale for their combined use in the therapeutic of KOA.

AB To effectively improve the absorption capacity of the integrated energy system (IES) to clean energy, reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the system, and improve the economic benefits of the system, this paper constructs a comprehensive energy system model that includes both electricity to hydrogen and hydrogen to gas and introduces the carbon dioxide trading mechanism, the green certificate trading mechanism and the response mechanism to the load demand. Different scenarios are set for example analysis and the model is solved using Matlab software's CPLEX solver. The results show that the operation strategy of the IES considering demand response under the carbon dioxide-green certificate joint trading mechanism performs best, reducing the total cost of the system by 65.8% and the carbon dioxide emissions by 23.1%, which can provide a strong reference and guidance for the low carbon dioxide economy operation of the IES.

ID MECHANISM
AB The plates of die cast AZ91D magnesium alloy were welded by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) with the filler metal of extruded AZ61 as well as AZ61 containing mixed rare earth elements and no filler metal. The porosity in the weldment and the chemical composition of the weld joints were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The results indicate that: there were many micropores and macropores around the fusion line in all welded specimens, and it is proposed that the former were mainly induced by hydrogen, while the latter were inherited from the porosity that were mainly nitrogen preexisting in the base metal. The amount of porosity in the weldment welded with AZ61 wire was less than that without filler metal, and the size of large pores was also decreased, which was the effect of dilution due to less gas inclusions in the filler material. A further decrease of the porosity was observed in the joint using filler wire AZ61 containing rare earths, and the probable mechanisms are following. On the one hand, the rare earth elements reduced effectively the hydrogen-induced porosity by increasing the solid solubility of H in the magnesium alloy, reacting with H to form hydrides and accelerating the escape velocity of bubbles. On the other hand, the porosity that resulted from N-2 was decreased to some extent too because the rare earths accelerated the overflow velocity of bubbles.

AB Developing visible light-responding photoelectrocatalysts with higher efficiency is highly demanded and broadly concerned in terms of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, we report that by constructing a TiO2/CuInS(2 )p-n junction and further decorating it with plasmonic Cu nanoparticles, the synthesized TiO2/CuInS2/Cu photoanodes show significantly enhanced visible light absorption and higher photoelectrocatalysis efficiency, benefiting from the joint influence of the built-in electric field and surface plasmonic resonance (SPR). Under > 420 nm light irradiation, the photocurrent density is 2.36 mA/ cm2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), enhanced by about 10 times than that of pure TiO2. Furthermore, the hydrogen production rate was enhanced from an undetectable level to 4.552 mu mol/cm(2)/h. Our results exhibit that the strategy of a double-layer co-catalyst has promising applications in water splitting and other solar energy-conversion areas.

AB Alternative approaches to replace total joint replacement are desirable to reduce the massive loss of healthy tissues. The tribological performance of the cartilage-diamond contact in deionized water and calf bovine serum environments was investigated in this study. To optimize lubrication, hydrogen and ammonia treatments were applied on diamond surfaces. Adhesion and wettability on the same were evaluated to determine the impact of functionalization on surface properties. It was found that the friction between the cartilage and diamond decreased with an increase in the load. This is related to the interaction between two contacting surfaces. Under dry conditions, the hydrogen treatment enabled a reduction in friction while the ammonia treatment increased it. The lubricated friction, however, is determined by two effects: the surface area covered by the lubricant and their interactions. Our results show that the microcrystalline diamond without functionalization provided the lowest friction (coefficient of 0.02-0.03) while sliding against cartilage in serum. The reason is that microcrystalline diamond attracts more molecules that dominate the lubricating performance. This research demonstrated that diamond materials could be suitable as implants as well as to locally repair them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The uncertainty of renewable energy undermines the competitiveness of Renewable Energy Generation Companies (REGC) in market bidding. Hydrogen energy storage, as a novel high-energy-density energy storage technology, is considered an ideal solution to address the uncertainty of renewable energy and provide flexible ramping products (FRP) to the grid. Building upon this, this paper combines hydrogen energy storage and renewable energy to build a hydrogen-wind-photovoltaic (HWP) system, and introduces HWP into the flexible ramping market for the first time, while participating in the energy market. To capture the interactions between HWP and market players with different utility functions, this paper establishes a bi-level bidding strategy model for HWP participation in the integrated energy and flexible ramping markets, It enables HWP to optimize its internal unit output to increase revenue based on current market conditions. In addition to this, the uncertainty of renewable energy output is taken into account in the upper-level model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage stochastic bi-level optimization scheduling model was validated on IEEE 6-bus and 36-bus transmission-constrained networks. Tests demonstrated that the proposed model effectively assists HWP in formulating optimal bidding strategies in the joint market under uncertainty. Compared to solely participating in a single energy market, HWP's simultaneous participation in energy and flexible ramping markets increased total revenue by 12.22%.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; DELIVERY; WINDOWS
AB This paper proposes a novel problem called the time-dependent hydrogen fuel cell vehicle routing problem with drones and variable drone speeds (TDHFCVRP-D-VDS). In this problem, a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are equipped with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform delivery and pickup services within the customers' time windows. The UAV is capable of performing pickup operations after the delivery service, as long as it does not exceed its energy capacity. The HFCV can launch and retrieve the UAV multiple times as needed throughout the routing process. We establish a mixed integer programming model to simultaneously minimize the total cost and makespan, and verify its accuracy by Gurobi. To tackle larger-scale instances, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with intelligent selection (NSGA-III-IS). The initial population is generated using four distinct approaches aimed at enhancing both diversity and quality. Considering the customers' time windows, we factor in the temporal-spatial distances between customers when generating the initial population. Our approach employs a two-phase algorithm for developing initial solutions. In the first phase, the algorithm focuses on generating UAV trips, while in the second phase, it creates joint delivery routes for both the HFCV and the UAV. To enhance the optimization process, we have developed four strategies for optimizing UAV speed. These strategies dynamically adjust the UAV's speed in response to the customers' time windows and the HFCVs' arrival times. Additionally, we have integrated an intelligent selection mechanism to optimize the execution probabilities of both general and problem-specific operators. The experimental results demonstrate the following: (1) The proposed NSGA-III-IS outperforms other variant algorithms and two benchmark algorithms; (2) UAVs significantly benefit from variable flight speeds, resulting in reduced costs and improved efficiency; (3) The HFCV with UAV joint delivery pattern is superior for reducing carbon emissions compared to other joint delivery patterns; (4) Longer customer time windows and optimized UAV speed strategies are effective in reducing the total cost, makespan, and total UAV hover waiting time; (5) Finally, a method that combines multi-attribute decision-making with principal component analysis is utilized to aid decision-makers in selecting satisfactory solutions.

AB Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric density (energy density per unit mass) of any fuel. The combustion of hydrogen releases energy in the form of heat. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the reaction releases energy in the form of electricity. Unlike hydrocarbon-based fuels, the generation of energy from either the combustion of hydrogen or the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell is not accompanied by the emission of greenhouse gases. This makes hydrogen a promising solution to solve global warming issues. However, hydrogen has a low volumetric density (low energy density per unit volume) which makes storing or transporting hydrogen extremely difficult and expensive. To accelerate the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, it is necessary to develop advanced hydrogen storage methods that have the potential to have a higher energy density. The hydrogen storage market is segmented by application into: (1) Stationary power: stored hydrogen is consumed for example in a fuel cell for use in backup power stations, refueling stations, power stations; (2) Portable power: hydrogen storage applications for electronic devices such as mobile phones, flash lights, and portable generators; and (3) Transportation: industries including automobiles, aerospace, unmanned aerial systems, and hydrogen tanks used throughout the hydrogen supply chain. The increasing devel-opment of light and heavy fuel cell vehicles is expected to drive the development of on-board solid-state hydrogen technologies. A large number of research groups worldwide for many years have been trying to develop materials having the right set of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, along with all of the physical properties (high gravimetric density, high volumetric density, etc.) to allow for low-pressure storage system in ambient conditions. However, to date, no material has been found that satisfies all the desired properties to be viably used in many appli-cations. Even if we consider only three parameters namely gravimetric density, volumetric density, and system cost, no materials that can meet the ultimate targets of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) or the 2030 targets of the European Union's Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan. The present article reviews advances in solid-state hydrogen storage technology and compares the opportunities and challenges of selected materials. The materials reviewed in this article have a wider spectrum than the materials reviewed in other existing articles, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), graphene, boron nitride (BN), fullerene, silicon, amorphous manganese hydride molecular sieve, and metal hydrides. Pioneering works, important breakthroughs, as well as the latest developments for promising materials are also reviewed. In addition, for the first time the targets set by several official regulatory agencies for solid-state hydrogen storage are summarized. Achievements in academic and industrial research are compared against these targets. The future prospects of promising materials are analyzed based on how its practical application can be implemented according to market needs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Surface pretreatment is of great significance for improving the welding quality of metal materials, especially aluminum alloys. At present, the welding process is introduced to join the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg alloys or their repair during manufacturing or service. However, the high susceptibility of hydrogen pores is one of the most important problems encountered in the fusion welding process of LPBF AlSi10Mg alloys. To clarify the influence of the surface state of the base metal on the hydrogen pore characteristics, the LPBF AlSi10Mg sheets were pretreated by chemical cleaning treatment (CCT), mechanical polishing treatment (MPT), and chemical cleaning treatment after mechanical polishing treatment (MPT-CCT) before laser welding. Subsequently, the hydrogen pore characteristics, microstructure, and micro-hardness of the welded joints were investigated. The experimental results show that laser welding with MPT-CCT significantly reduces the porosity and pore diameter. In addition, MPT-CCT can eliminate most of the broken and discontinuous surface oxide film and Mg enrichment. In summary, the necessity of MPT-CCT for LPBF AlSi10Mg alloys is analyzed systematically, which is of great significance to improve the welding quality.

AB Background: Native and periprosthetic joint infections are devastating conditions fraught with patient morbidity and mortality. Aseptic and septic joints are often debrided and irrigated to decrease bacterial loads when preventing or treating infection. However, the effect of clinically used irrigation solutions on the native cellular components of the synovial joint is unknown. Methods: Patients consented, and their suprapatellar knee tissue was surgically excised for fibroblast isolation. Cultured knee fibroblasts were treated with normal saline for three minutes or one of the following experimental solutions: acetic acid, chlorhexidine-gluconate, Dakin's solution, hydrogen peroxide, or povidone-iodine. The exposure time for the antiseptic solutions was one and three minutes. At 24 hours after irrigation treatment, metabolic activity was measured via MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] activity assay, and deoxyribonucleic acid content was assessed by Hoechst staining as a surrogate for cell number. Phase-contrast imaging elucidated proliferation potential, progressive cell loss, and cell morphology over a 5-day period. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Results: All experimental antiseptic irrigation solutions, regardless of application time, caused a significant reduction in metabolic activity and DNA content, indicating extensive cell death. Phase-contrast imaging showed halted cellular proliferation, progressive cell loss, and distinct changes in cellular morphology, indicating decreased cellular viability and progressive cell death. Conclusions: All antiseptic irrigation solutions investigated in this study were severely cytotoxic to human knee fibroblasts regardless of their chemical composition. The concentrations of these solutions are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery. Although these solutions have high bactericidal properties, it may be beneficial to use them in combination at lower doses to retain their effect on bacteria while remaining benign to native synovial cells.

TI Investigating the impact of roller position on pressure tube-end fitting
   rolled joint performance using 3D explicit finite element analysis

LA English
DT Article
ID DELAYED HYDRIDE CRACKING; ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS
AB Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) utilize Zr-2.5 Nb pressure tubes that are connected to SS-403 end fittings through rolled joints. These rolled joints are made using a rolling tool equipped with five rollers and a tapered mandrel. The action of the rollers induces plastic deformation on the inner surface of the tube. The tapered mandrel promotes rotation and axial advancement of the rollers into the pressure tube through friction. However, prolonged usage of this rolling tool can lead to the wearing down of both the mandrel and the rollers. Consequently, this wear and tear can cause the rollers to deviate from their intended position within the rolled joint. Such misalignment can lead to excessive rolling of the pressure tube into the entry taper section of the end fitting. This, in turn, generates higher residual stresses than initially anticipated. This issue may also arise from accumulated tolerances within the rolling tool or positioning errors made by operators during the rolling operation. The overextension of the rollers can significantly increase tensile residual stresses within the pressure tube, and management of these stresses is critical to prevent failure of the pressure tube due to Delayed Hydrogen Cracking.The primary objective of the present investigation is to explore the effects of the overextension of rollers on the residual tensile stresses in the transition region of the rolled joint. This objective is achieved by employing a three-dimensional explicit finite element analysis methodology. In order to ensure the reliability and authenticity of the finite element model, the computational results are cross-validated with the experimental findings documented in the existing literature. The current investigation involves the examination of two distinct configurations of pressure tube to end fitting rolled joints, which are typically found in PHWRs. The results of the present inquiry reveal an optimal roller position that minimizes residual tensile stresses within the transition region of a rolled joint. Furthermore, it is observed that any deviations in the roller position within a range of 5 mm, beyond the optimal position, result in a negligible increase in residual tensile stress.

SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB In case of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), in-calandria retention of corium is essential for mitigating core melt down accident. Benchmark calculations have shown that if corium breaches the calandria vessel and enters the calandria vault, large amount of hydrogen and other fission gases may be generated due to molten corium concrete interaction (MCCI). There is possibility of containment failure. Hence, the best option is to contain the corium inside the calandria vessel and cool it from outside by calandria vault water. PHWR calandria vessel thicknesses varies from 22 mm to 32 mm and have weld joints due to the steps involved. It is true that smaller calandria vessel thickness has lower temperature gradient and may promote higher heat transfer rate. However, there is an international concern about the healthiness of the thin vessel with stepped weld joints due to the thermal loading of high temperature corium melt which can lead to excessive thermal strain of vessel and weld joints and it may result in failure before the corium stabilization inside the vessel is achieved. In the present study, experiments were conducted in a scaled facility of an Indian PHWR to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviour of simulated stepped calandria vessel with weld joints. The temperature distributions and the strain contours of vessel were recorded. Numerical analysis was carried out to validate the FEM model with the test data and also analysis was extended to predict the thermo mechanical behaviour of prototypic stepped calandria vessel.

AB Hydrogen process equipment are often housed in 20-foot or 40-foot container either be at refueling stations or at the portable standalone power generation units. Shipping Container provide an easy to install, cost effective, all weather protective containment. Hydrogen has unique physical properties, it can quickly form an ignitable cloud for any accidental release or leakages in air, due to its wide flammability limits. Identifying the hazards associated with these kind of container applications are very crucial for design and safe operation of the container hydrogen installations. Recently both numerical studies and experiment have been performed to ascertain the level of hazards and its possible mitigation methods for hydrogen applications. This paper presents the numerical modelling and the simulations performed using the HyFOAM CFD solver for vented deflagrations processes. HyFOAM solver is developed in-house using the open source CFD toolkit OpenFOAM libraries. The turbulent flame deflagrations are modelled using the flame wrinkling combustion model. This combustion model is further improved to account for flame instabilities dominant role in vented lean hydrogen-air mixtures deflagrations. The 20-foot ISO containers of dimensions 20' x 8' x 8'.6 '' filled with homogeneous mixture of hydrogen-air at different concentration, with and without model obstacles are considered for numerical simulations. The numerical predictions are first validated against the recent experiments carried out by Gexcon as part of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The effects of congestion within the containers on the generated overpressures are investigated. The preliminary CFD predictions indicated that the container walls deflections are having considerable effect on the trends of generated overpressures, especially the peak negative pressure generated within the container is overestimated. Hence to account for the container wall deflections, the fluid structure interactions (FSI) are also included in the numerical modelling. The final numerical predictions are presented with and without the FSI. The FSI modelling considerably improved the numerical prediction and resulted in better match of overpressure trends with the experimental results. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB The dynamics of the Universe is analyzed using an exponential function for the dark energy equation of state, known as Gong-Zhang parameterization. The phase space of the free parameters presented in the model is constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, Cosmic Chronometers, modulus distance from Hydrogen II Galaxies, Type Ia Supernovae and measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, together with a stronger bound from a Joint analysis. The cosmological model is confronted with ?CDM, observing there is a strong evidence for ?CDM in the Joint analysis although the exponential model is preferred when the data are separated. Based on the Joint analysis, a value of omega 0 = -1.202+0.027 -0.026 is found for the characteristic parameter presented in the equation of state. Additionally, the cosmographic parameters at current times are reported, having q0 = -0.789+0.034 -0.036, j0 = 1.779+0.130 -0.119, and a transition deceleration-acceleration redshift zT = 0.644+0.011 -0.012. Furthermore, the age of the Universe is estimated as tU = 13.788+0.019 -0.019 Gyrs. Finally, we open a discussion if this model could alleviate the H0 and S8 tensions.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The 5B70 aluminum alloy holds broad application prospects in the aerospace industry, yet welding thick aluminum alloys encounters challenges such as porosity, weld formation issues, and coarse grain. In this study, 20 mm thick 5B70 aluminum alloy plates were joined using electron beam welding with oscillation and wire feeding techniques. The effect of oscillation amplitude on weld formation, porosity, grain structure, and mechanical properties of the joints was comprehensively investigated. From the cross-sectional morphologies of the joints, it is evident that porosity defects are distributed throughout the weld, which could be distinguished into metallurgical and process types, with characteristics influenced by hydrogen evolution and keyhole instability, respectively. Oscillation notably improved weld formation, practically eliminating the reinforcement height and porosity at an amplitude of 1 mm. Additionally, oscillation facilitated melt pool stirring, leading to a reduction in internal dislocation density and a refinement of grain size from 5.6 to 4.5 mu m. This process significantly enhanced the mechanical performance of the joints, with ultimate tensile strength reaching up to 352.2 +/- 25 MPa through the reduction of porosity and grain size, demonstrating the potential of combining oscillation and wire feeding techniques in electron beam welding of thick aluminum alloy for improved weld quality.

AB High selectivity of cyclic-nucleotide binding (CNB) domains for cAMP and cGMP are required for segregating signaling pathways; however, the mechanism of selectivity remains unclear. To investigate the mechanism of high selectivity in cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), we determined a room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of PKG I beta CNB-B, a domain 200-fold selective for cGMP over cAMP, bound to cGMP (2.2 angstrom), and a low-temperature X-ray structure of CNB-B with cAMP (1.3 angstrom). The XN structure directly describes the hydrogen bonding interactions that modulate high selectivity for cGMP, while the structure with cAMP reveals that all these contacts are disrupted, explaining its low affinity for cAMP.

AB Precisely modulating both the fine structures and exciton behaviors of covalent organic framework (COF)-based photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is still a great challenge. Herein, we report two COFs, fluorenone-based COF (FOO-COF) and fluorenyl-based COF (FO-COF), for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The results demonstrated that FOO-COF achieved a remarkable stability and hydrogen evolution rate of 119.1 mmol/h/g, surpassing those of many previously reported COF-based photocatalysts, thus resulting in an apparent quantum efficiency up to 20.5% at 435 nm. The joint observations from temperature-dependent photoluminescence, the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy confirm that FOO-COF shows a stronger carrier separation and migration ability, much lower exciton binding energy, and faster dissociation speed of singlet and triplet excitons than FO-COF. More importantly, the femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra (fs-TAS) revealed the great difference between the two COFs in electron trapping and exciton dissociation after Pt loading. Furthermore, theoretical calculations unveiled the feasibility of C=O groups in the LUMO sites of FOO-COF as active electronic centers for anchoring the photodeposited Pt cocatalysts, due to its much lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and more negative charge density. We believe that the introduction of C=O groups in the FOO-COF can act as both a dominant electronic collection center and partial active sites, which improve the D-A polarizability and boost the generation, separation, migration, and utilization of photogenerated carriers in the FOO-COF for achieving remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The insights into the molecular-level mechanism in this work may guide the significance of the rational design of COF structures for advanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

AB Driven by lightweight requirements in the low-altitude economy, a synergistic laser ablation-silane coupling process was developed to optimize friction stir welded joints between Al alloys and carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTPs), with a focus on elucidating the sequence-dependent gradient interfacial joining mechanism. A sequence involving silane coupling prior to laser ablation was employed, enabling dual-mode enhancement of the interfacial geometric configuration and chemical bonding. Mechanical interlocking was ensured in laser-ablated zones, whereas the chemical bonding capacity in unablated regions was enhanced. The tensile-shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al-O-Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films. This synergistic strategy provides new insights for the high-performance joining of dissimilar metal and polymer materials.

Although silicones offer excellent properties such as resistance to extreme temperatures and weather conditions, as well as flexibility, their low surface energy limits their application as adhesives. To address this issue, we added a hydrogen-containing silicone adhesion promoter to an addition-curing silicone adhesive. We also introduced functional groups on the aluminum and glass adherends through air plasma (AP) surface treatment. These modifications were made to improve the interface between the adhesive and the adherend. We also added hydrophobic fumed silica to the adhesive formulation to enhance its overall bond strength and toughness. The single lap-shear tests were carried out to study the lap-shear strength (LSS) of the adhesively bonded joints. It was shown that the presence of the adhesion promoter on AP-treated adherends results in a minimum increase of 196 % in LSS. It was observed that the adhesion promoter has a plasticizing effect in the absence of AP treatment, resulting in poor mechanical strength of the joints. Fumed silica has been shown to significantly impact the LSS of aluminum and glass adherends, increasing it by a factor of 3 and 4, respectively, at the concentration of 5 phr. In all cases, glass specimens exhibited stronger bonds.

AB Since the seminal discovery by van der Waals in the late 19 th century that weak attractive forces exist between even electrically neutral atoms or molecules, a number of noncovalent interactions have been recognized. Among them, electrostatic interactions such as hydrogen bonds play pivotal roles in countless chemical processes and biochemical living systems. By mimicking biocatalysis, various organocatalysts equipped with hydrogen-bond functionality have been developed; however, a challenge has persisted in designing catalysts exploiting other types of noncovalent interactions. Here, we report metal-free hydroboration reactions of carbonyl compounds and CO2 catalyzed by aromatic diazadiborinine. A joint experimental and computational study on the reaction mechanism suggests that adducts of diazadiborinine with carbonyl and CO2 formed at the initial stage of the reactions serve as actual catalysts. The former stabilizes the transition state by using the electrostatic interaction between the hydride of borane and the polar, hole-shaped structure of the adduct.

AB Swapping the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the thermodynamically advantageous sulfur ion oxidation reaction (SOR) makes it possible to produce low-energy hydrogen. We report here on an electrocatalytic SOR-coupled HER system that allows for the joint production of sulfur and hydrogen. We prepare a CoMoO4 nanoarray on nickel foam (NF) for anodic SOR and N-doped CoMoO4/NF, CoMoN/NF, for cathodic HER. The current density of 100 mA cm(-2) was obtained at 0.29 V (vs RHE) in the SOR process. After nitridation, the electrode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in HER at a voltage of only 32 mV (vs RHE). The coupling system (SOR//HER) can run steadily for 150 h. Detailed exploration and discussion were conducted on the pathways of SOR. This work develops an energy-efficient mixed water electrolysis system for H-2, providing a viable option for toxic waste treatment.

DE Optimal weight algorithm; Dynamic time scale; Stability
AB The study of time scale facilitates stable and reliable operation of time-keeping systems. Algos algorithm is a common method for calculating the time scale. Improving the stability of the time scale is an important issue in the research of time-keeping technology. In this paper, an optimization method of the clock difference data preprocessing in algorithm is proposed. We apply the theory of optimal weight to the calculation of time scale weight for improving the stability of the dynamic time scale. The proposed algorithm is called Improved Dynamic Algos-like (IDAlgos). We use the IDAlgos for joint experiments of cesium clocks ensemble, hydrogen masers ensemble, and hydrogen-cesium clocks ensemble, respectively. The results compared with Conventional Dynamic Algos-like (CDAlgos) show that i) for the case of cesium clocks ensemble, the short-term stability has been improved, the stability increased by 22.5% in 2 h and 20.8% in 4 h. ii) for the case of hydrogen masers ensemble, the stability increased by 18.3% in 1 h and 31.3% in 128 h, that is, both long-term and short-term stability has been improved. iii) for the clock ensemble combined of hydrogen masers and cesium clocks, the long-term and short-term stability has been greatly improved,among them, the stability increased by 64.6% in 1 h and 69.3% in 128 h. Consequently, the IDAlgos has obvious improving on the stability of the time scale

AB A new potassium cadmium hydrogen diphosphate dihydrate, KCdHP2O7 center dot 2H(2)0 (1), has been synthesized by slow evaporation at room temperature and characterized by FT-IR, Raman, TG-DTA, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound (1) crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pcmn space group with the unit cell parameters a= 6.5814(8) angstrom, b = 7.9428(9) angstrom, c = 15.961(6) angstrom, V 834.4(3) angstrom(3) and Z = 4. Its structure consists of polyhedral layers parallel to the ab plane where each CdO6 octahedron (m position) shares four edges with three different diphosphate groups. In the Cd octahedron, two oxygen atoms residing in (m) special positions belong to coordinated water molecules. These layers are joint by K+ cations (4c Wyckoff position) and hydrogen bonds, leading thus to a two-dimensional framework. The structural model is supported by the bond-valence-sum validation tool as calculated valences are close to the formal oxidation numbers.

AB In the present work, the influence of hot-dip galvanization (HDG) on the fatigue behaviour of high-strength bolted details is investigated through a set of 15 constant-amplitude tests. Cyclic behaviour of coated specimens is hence compared against results for unprotected samples drawn from literature, i.e., both with reference to neutral and aggressive exposure conditions. Namely, while behaviour of coated samples is moderately inferior as respect to uncoated ones in dry air (-6 % in terms of characteristic fatigue strength, probability of failure PF = 5 %, confidence interval CI = 75 %), their performance still complies with European normative requirements for double covered joints, and galvanization proves to be highly effective when corrosion is likely to occur (with a characteristic strength increase of [+12 %; +52 %]). Finally, fractography analyses on both uncoated and coated specimens were performed, suggesting that hydrogen embrittlement may play a role in reducing fatigue strength of coated joints, that is, especially within the high-cycle fatigue regime.

Undergraduate plasma physics students from three universities-Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (National Research University), RUDN University, and National Research Nuclear University MEPhI-carried out joint remote experiments to train in tokamak operation and to study topics relevant for mainstream fusion research such as plasma start-up, comparison of hydrogen versus helium plasma characteristics, electrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence, long-range correlations, etc. New observations of the long-range correlations between low-frequency (<50 kHz) quasi-coherent electrostatic and magnetic oscillations identified as m = 2 mode with several techniques were done, as well as of the broadband (<250 kHz) magnetic oscillations resolved in frequency and wave vector in helium and hydrogen plasmas. The presence of broadband electrostatic and broadband magnetic turbulence has also been established at the plasma edge.

AB A high Cr-Ni austenite wire with 0.1% nitrogen was developed for gas metal arc welding of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel (10Ni5CrMoV) to prevent hydrogen induced crack. The austenite weld joint without visible defects can be obtained using Ar + He + N-2 shielding gas. When N-2 content of shielding gas increased from 0% to 8%, the nitrogen content of weld metal rose from 0.10% to 0.19%, and other alloy content kept unchanged. The increasing of nitrogen content in weld metal made weld grains refined. It can improve mechanical properties of weld metal in different degrees including yield strength, tensile strength, elongation and impact toughness. However, with 8% N-2 content of shielding gas, the massive microspores appeared in weld metal will decrease the welded joint properties. Therefore, 50%Ar + 45%He + 5%N-2 was selected for welding of 10Ni5CrMoV HSLA steel using high Cr-Ni austenite wire.

AB The crisscross progress of transportation and energy carries the migrating track of human society development and the evolution of civilization, among which the decarbonization strategy is a key issue. Traffic carbon emissions account for 16.2% of total energy carbon emissions, while road traffic carbon emissions account for 11.8% of total energy carbon emissions. Therefore, road traffic is a vital battlefield in attaining the goal of decarbonization. Employing clean energy as an alternative fuel is of great significance to the transformation of the energy consumption structure in road transportation. Hydrogen and ammonia are renewable energy with the characteristics of being widely distributed and clean. Both exist naturally in nature, and the products of complete combustion are substances (water and nitrogen) that do not pollute the atmosphere. Because it can promote agricultural production, ammonia has a long history in human society. Both have the potential to replace traditional fossil fuel energy. An overview of the advantages of hydrogen and ammonia, as well as their development in different countries such as the United States, the European Union, Japan, and other major development regions is presented in this paper. Related research topics of hydrogen and ammonia's production, storage and transferring technology have also been analyzed and collated to stimulate the energy production chain for road transportation. The current cost of green hydrogen is between $2.70-$8.80 globally, which is expected to approach $2-$6 by 2030. Furthermore, the technical development of hydrogen and ammonia as a fuel for engines and fuel cells in road transportation is compared in detail, and the tests, practical applications and commercial popularization of these technologies are summarized, respectively. Opportunities and challenges coexist in the era of the renewable energy. Based on the characteristics and development track of hydrogen and ammonia, the joint development of these two types of energy is meant to be imperative. The collaborative development mode of hydrogen and ammonia, together with the obstacles to their development of them are both compared and discussed. Finally, referring to the efforts and experiences of different countries in promoting hydrogen and ammonia in road transportation, corresponding constructive suggestions have been put forward for reference. At the end of the paper, a framework diagram of hydrogen and ammonia industry chains is provided, and the mutual promotion development relationship of the two energy sources is systematically summarized.

AB Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) is one of the promising hydrogen production technologies. Studying the operation characteristics of multi-energy coupling system based on photocatalytic hydrogen production is beneficial to the popularization and application of this technology. A novel zero-carbon emission system that integrates freshwater, hydrogen, and electricity co-generation driven by solar energy is developed in this paper. The integrated system comprises a multistage flash desalination (MSFD) subsystem, a PWS subsystem, and a fuel cell (FC) subsystem. Considering the inherent variability and intermittency of solar energy availability, an energy storage module is strategically implemented to ensure stable and reliable system operation. The detailed model of the complete integrated system is meticulously developed and refined using Aspen Plus software. Taking the meteorological data of Hainan, China as an example, the operational parameters of the system are designed. Parametric analyses are conducted on the system's freshwater production, hydrogen generation, and electricity output. A comprehensive evaluation is made on the thermodynamic and environmental aspects of the integrated system. The results demonstrate that the system, designed to operate continuously throughout the year, achieves this with an initial storage capacity of 85 m3 for freshwater and 130 kmol for hydrogen. Over an annual cycle, MSFD subsystem produces approximately 1812.23 m3 of freshwater, while PWS subsystem utilizes 1560.00 m3 of this freshwater to generate 2830.82 kg of hydrogen. Subsequently, FC subsystem consumes approximately 2816.63 kg of hydrogen per year to generate 43,800 kWh of electricity, while the total annual electricity consumption for the integrated system is recorded at 1995.01 kWh. The system demonstrates an average annual energy efficiency of 58.4 % and exergy efficiency of 11.2 %, illustrating both effective energy use and conversion. Furthermore, the system's operation leads to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, amounting to a total annual decrease of 31884.98 kg. Collectively, the significant contribution of this study is to emphasize the potential of autonomously operated joint systems through the synergistic utilization of renewable energy and hydrogen energy. The specific innovative zero-carbon emission system, driven by solar energy, provides a theoretical framework for the development of integrated strategies for the utilization of solar and hydrogen energy.

AB The effects of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) on guanidinium chloride and hydrogen-bonded networks of water are explored in this joint Raman spectroscopic and quantum chemical study. Both TMAO and guanidinium are osmolytes that affect the stability of proteins, as TMAO is known to stabilize and counteract the destabilizing effects of guanidinium. While guanidinium is very similar in chemical structure to urea, the exact mechanisms of the molecular interactions between guanidinium, TMAO, and proteins continue to be investigated. Herein, we use Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the physical interactions between TMAO and guanidinium in aqueous solutions to better understand how these important osmolytes interact with each other and affect adjacent hydrogen-bonding networks of water. Comparing experiment to theory yields good agreement and allows for the identification and tracking of different vibrational modes. It was determined that adding TMAO into an aqueous solution of guanidinium induces a blue shift (shift to higher energy) in guanidinium's H-N-H bending modes, which is indicative of direct interactions between the two osmolytes and similar to the earlier results observed for TMAO interacting with urea.

AB The use of cold metal transfer process (CMT) is an excellent alternative to depositing nickel-based alloys on oil and gas pipelines due to the relatively small dilution. However, sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) of dissimilar weld joints has proven to be an issue. Therefore, this study investigates the microstructure and SSCC behavior of an Inconel 625/ X80 weld overlay fabricated CMT process focusing on the tempering effect. Four-point bending tests show a high SSCC susceptibility of the non-overlap zone due to the forma-tion of coarse structure in the heat affected zone and narrow martensite layer along the fusion boundary. However, microstructural characterization indicates a tempering effect in the overlap zone, producing homogenized microstructure and less residual strain in the heat affected zone. Therefore, the SSCC resistance is greatly improved, especially for the fusion boundary, because reversed austenite in the martensite layer could decrease the accumulation of hydrogen at lath boundaries.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Background: Antiseptic solutions are commonly utilized during total joint arthroplasty (TJA) to prevent and treat periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The purpose of this study was to investigate which antiseptic solution is most effective against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Escherichia coli biofilms established in vitro on orthopaedic surfaces commonly utilized in total knee arthroplasty: cobalt-chromium (CC), oxidized zirconium (OxZr), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Methods: MSSA and E. coli biofilms were grown on CC, OxZr, and PMMA discs for 24 and 72 hours. Biofilm-coated discs were treated with control or various antiseptic solutions for 3 minutes. Solutions included 10% povidone-iodine, a 1:1 mixture of 10% povidone-iodine plus 3% hydrogen peroxide, diluted povidone-iodine, 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate, and a surfactant-based formulation of ethanol, acetic acid, sodium acetate, benzalkonium chloride, and water. Following treatment, discs were sonicated to quantify adherent bacteria or underwent imaging with scanning electron microscopy to identify biofilm. Antiseptic solutions were considered efficacious if they produced a 3-log (1,000-fold) reduction in colony-forming units compared with controls. Results: On both OxZr and CC, 10% povidone-iodine with hydrogen peroxide eradicated all MSSA, and it achieved clinical efficacy on PMMA at both 24-hour MSSA biofilm (p < 0.0002) and 72-hour MSSA biofilm (p = 0.002). On 72-hour MSSA biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine eradicated all bacteria on OxZr and CC, and it achieved clinical efficacy on PMMA (p = 0.04). On 24-hour MSSA biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine achieved efficacy on all surfaces (all p < 0.01). The surfactant-based formulation only achieved clinical efficacy on 72-hour MSSA biofilms on CC (p = 0.04) and OxZr (p = 0.07). On 72-hour E. coli biofilm, 10% povidone-iodine with or without hydrogen peroxide achieved clinical efficacy on all surfaces. No other solution achieved clinical efficacy on either MSSA or E. coli. Conclusions: Antiseptic solutions vary considerably in efficacy against bacterial biofilm. The 10% povidone-iodine solution with or without hydrogen peroxide consistently removed MSSA and E. coli biofilms on multiple orthopaedic surfaces and should be considered for clinical use. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians should be aware of the differences in the efficacy of antiseptic solutions on different orthopaedic surfaces when treating MSSA or E. coli biofilms.

AB The internal cracking observed in a 6 ''-thick carbon-manganese steel plate after welding is discussed with respect to the presence of material impurities. The morphology and location of the cracks detected during fabrication of a heavy structure are typical of hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) usually associated to hard untempered martensite. However, typically martensitic microstructures would not be expected for low carbon low alloy steels joints when a suitable welding procedure specification is adopted, which includes preheating and high heat input. This paper illustrates the morphology of the original cracks, which are unrelated to hard microstructures, and presents the results of the welding experiments conducted in samples cut from segregated regions of the 6 ''-thick plate. Through hydrogenation of thin slices containing impure regions and autogenous gas tungsten arc welding bead, it was possible to reproduce the same cracking characteristics formed during submerged arc welding, indicating that HIC may also be associated to softer phases. Hydrogen entrapment at the weld fusion line can be related to high impurities level due to the expected lower melting points at grain boundaries, explaining the HIC phenomenon. The present paper proposes a model for hydrogen cracking of bainitic structures at the welding heat affected zone that typically is not susceptible to crack. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Energy storage plays an essential role in stabilizing fluctuations in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, enabling surplus electricity retention, and delivering dynamic frequency regulation. However, relying solely on a single form of storage often proves insufficient due to constraints in performance, capacity, and cost-effectiveness. To tackle frequency regulation challenges in remote desert-based renewable energy hubs-where traditional power infrastructure is unavailable-this study introduces a planning framework for an electro-hydrogen energy storage system with grid-forming capabilities, designed to supply both inertia and frequency response. At the system design stage, a direct current (DC) transmission network is modeled, integrating battery and hydrogen storage technologies. Using this configuration, the capacity settings for both grid-forming batteries and hydrogen units are optimized. This study then explores how hydrogen systems-comprising electrolyzers, storage tanks, and fuel cells-and grid-forming batteries contribute to inertial support. Virtual inertia models are established for each technology, enabling precise estimation of the total synthetic inertia provided. At the operational level, this study addresses stability concerns stemming from renewable generation variability by introducing three security indices. A joint optimization is performed for virtual inertia constants, which define the virtual inertia provided by energy storage systems to assist in frequency regulation, and primary frequency response parameters within the proposed storage scheme are optimized in this model. This enhances the frequency modulation potential of both systems and confirms the robustness of the proposed approach. Lastly, a real-world case study involving a 13 GW renewable energy base in Northwest China, connected via a +/- 10 GW HVDC export corridor, demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the optimization strategy and system configuration.

AB The formation process of the active component of 0.5%Pd-0.5%Ag catalysts supported on the carbon black/ pyrolytic synthetic carbon composite << Sibunit >>, which were synthesized by joint impregnation, was studied. XRD and EXAFS studies revealed that heating of the Pd-Ag/Sibunit catalyst in hydrogen at 400-500 degrees C results in the formation of bimetallic solid solution Pd0.6Ag0.4. The bimetallic particles are characterized by an increased distance between neighboring palladium atoms (2.78-2.80 angstrom), as compared to metallic palladium and by an increase in the electron density on palladium atoms under the action of silver (according to XPS data). The synthesized samples with supported Pd-Ag nanoparticles make it possible to obtain C2H4 by ethyne hydrogenation with the selectivity of 77-78%.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease which results in progressive destruction of the joint. In this study, we examined if the hydrogen could inhibit inflammation in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via oxidative stress on RA-FLSs. Moreover, to identify the mechanisms of action, we evaluated the effect of hydrogen on RA-FLSs development and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways. Based on our result, H-2 enriched medium can increase super oxide dismutase (SOD) level following H2O2 treatment and decrease 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level. Since H2O2 treatment activates MAPK, NF-kappa B and TGF-beta 1 in cells, our study suggested that H-2 could inhibit H2O2 activated MAPK and NF-kappa B activation as well as TGF-beta 1 expression in treated cells. Taken together, our data suggested that H-2 can directly neutralize OH and ONOO-to reduce oxidative stress. Moreover, MAPK and NF-kappa B pathway also play roles in oxidative damage caused by H2O2 in RA-FLSs. H-2 can provide protection to cells against inflammation, which may be related to inhibition of the activation of MAPK and NF-kappa B.

AB The formation of brittle microstructures around the fusion line in dissimilar welds has required a deeper microstructural analysis in this region. The study becomes more relevant when these welds are used in environments that facilitate hydrogen embrittlement. The present work aims to characterize the microstructure and hardness at the diluted zone interface in joints welded with dissimilar materials. Aiming for a better efficacy in the microstructural characterization of this zone, samples of both normal cross-section (NCS) and section with slope were used, according to the low-angle microsectioning (LAMS) technique, which allows a greater amplification of partially mixed zones (PMZs). The results indicated the diffusion of carbon from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) towards the fusion line which, in combination with other alloying elements, form highly brittle carbides. In turn, the hardness of the base metal and the HAZ was reduced after post weld heat treatment, whereas in the weld metal an opposite behavior was observed. The dissimilar interface was promising for applications in environments facilitating hydrogen embrittlement, especially regarding the characteristics of zone Phi.

AB New policies and strict emission limits in the transports sector result in a gradual switch towards alternative fuels and hydrogen is getting attention: fuel cell systems are considered ideal energy converters of the next future. As the interest is rising in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), there is a need for experimental research and dedicated laboratories on systems designed with Balance of Plant. In this context, the HI-SEA Laboratory (240-kW PEMFC by Nuvera FC, a joint between the University of Genoa-Fincantieri) was born. In this paper, the tuning of the laboratory to simulate a ship-likely environment is addressed, looking at the main problematics and resolutions, related to the cathodic line and the cooling control. Some guidelines are defined to install a PEMFC system onboard a ship exploiting the existing infrastructure. Thanks to the experimental campaign, a stack voltage model previously validated is employed to evaluate the performance of the system. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Flexible wearable sensors originating from ionogels have found extensive and significant applications in electronic skins, body-health monitoring, and personal healthcare diagnosis. Developing an ionogel-based sensor with robust mechanics and durable sensing in a wide service temperature range remains challenging. Herein, a high-performance wearable sensor with temperature-tolerant mechanics and durable sensing was constructed by virtue of hydrogen bonding between a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-incorporated nanocomposite interpenetrating network and an ionic liquid, i.e., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([C4mim][I]). Through modulation of hydrogen bonding and thus good compatibility between [C4mim][I] and the network, the ionogels exhibited superior mechanics, excellent antifatigue, and durable sensing in a wide working temperature range. The ionogel-based wearable sensor exhibited stable and repeatable sensitivity toward various human motions including finger bending, elbow joint bending, and swallowing. More importantly, the pressure sensing can be completely preserved in a service temperature range of -20 to 80 degrees C. This work provided a feasible method to construct a mechanically strong, temperature-durable ionogel-based multimode sensor, which would find versatile applications as electronic skins, human-motion detection, and intelligent devices.

AB The reformer effluent is serially cooled down to produce hydrogen in the hydrogen unit of an oil refinery. The process heat from effluent is effectively utilized for low pressure steam generation using heat exchanger. The exchanger shell and tube side fluids were boiler feed water and process gas, respectively. Several tubes of this heat exchanger were failed especially within tube sheet after 4 years of useful service. Therefore, failed exchanger tube was subjected to engineering failure analysis to determine the cause of failure. Initially visual inspection was conducted using videoscopy in heat exchanger dry condition and evidenced circumferential crack. Subsequently, all failed tubes were separated from U tube bundle. Selected tube was subjected to visual inspection, dye penetrant and dimensional measurement. No evidence of visual deformation and thickness loss observed in the failed tube. Further investigated tube was subjected to chemical analysis and confirmed the required metallurgy as per design specification. The fracture surface was subjected to elemental analysis, fractographic, metallographic and hardness investigations. The micro hardness of an exchanger tube at failure location was higher than specified hardness value. Investigation also revealed that exchanger tubes were expanded from tube inner surface to establish tube to tube sheet joint according to specified design drawing. Tube expansion was done prior to start of service and attributed to residual stress within tube material. The results revealed that presence of chloride in the accumulated deposits within tube to tube sheet joint favored conducive environment for chloride stress corrosion cracking. Recommendations were suggested for failure prevention. Achievement in this paper may supplement the similar heat exchanger tube failure database and mitigation of failure will be possible by good engineering practices.

AB In order to achieve energy consumption optimization and decarbonization in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), this article establishes a novel framework for optimal scheduling of park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs). This framework incorporates carbon capture technologies alongside a multienergy joint supply subsystem model featuring hydrogen storage, complemented by a structured stepped carbon trading mechanism. Furthermore, a novel optimized federation model is developed to balance low carbon emissions and economic performance by federating the carbon capture system into the tiered carbon trading mechanism. The primary objective of this model in the context of the IIoT is to minimize energy procurement costs, wind abandonment costs, and carbon trading expenses while maximizing revenues from carbon dioxide sales. The CPLEX optimization tool is utilized to address this complex challenge. Finally, several scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimized PIESs in reducing the operational costs and minimizing carbon footprint.

AB This article describes the history of the investigations of shock wave interactions at the Physical Gasdynamic Department, starting from the early 50s of the last century, when the first research related to missile reentry was made. The review focuses on a number of topics studied over more than 50 years and includes the study of strong shock waves, where it is necessary to take into account the physicochemical transformations in gases, shock wave reflection, diffraction, interaction with the boundary layer and with the nozzle, as well as detonation wave formation and interactions. The investigation of shock wave interactions is a current topic at the Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Some new results are observed: the formation of impulse jets and the self-ignition of a cold hydrogen jet, diffraction of 3D shock waves, and the effect of an impulse jet and diffracted shock wave on an obstacle.

AB In this work, the Ni-Mg-O oxide system was studied as a constituent of the joint Ni-Mg-O/V-Mg-O catalytic system in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. A sol-gel method was used to synthesize the samples in order to achieve high textural characteristics of the system and a uniform distribution of NiO particles in the matrix of magnesium oxide. It was demonstrated that the addition of the Ni-Mg-O component led to a significant increase in the yield of ethylene at temperatures of 600-650 degrees C. In this case, selectivity did not decrease significantly. The redox properties of Ni-Mg-O were studied in the cycles of temperature-programmed reduction in an atmosphere of hydrogen or carbon monoxide and subsequent reoxidation with atmospheric oxygen. It was shown that the Ni-Mg-O system can repeatedly uptake hydrogen and convert CO; this fact makes it possible to consider this material as a promising oxygen carrier for chemical looping. The observed increase in the yield of ethylene was due to the uptake of hydrogen released at the stage of ethane dehydrogenation and the related shift of thermodynamic equilibrium.

AB This paper presents a statistically more likely distribution (SMLD) approach for the evaluation of the presumed probability density function (PDF) in flamelet progress variable (FPV) models for non-premixed supersonic combustion. The numerical simulation of the NASA Langley Research Center supersonic H-2-Air combustion chamber is performed using two approaches: the first one is a standard FPV model, built presuming the functional shape of the PDFs of the mixture fraction, Z, and of the progress parameter, Lambda; the second approach employs the SMLD technique to presume the joint PDF of Z and Lambda. The standard and FPV-SMLD models have been developed using the low Mach number assumption. In both cases, the temperature is evaluated by solving the total-energy conservation equation, providing a more suitable approach for the simulation of supersonic combustion. By comparison with experimental data, the proposed SMLD model is shown to provide a clear improvement with respect to the standard FPV model, especially in the auto-ignition and stabilization regions of the flame.

AB Inflammatory arthritis primarily involves rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA), both characterized by shared inflammation in the articular joints and cartilage degeneration. These conditions lead to joint pain, loss of function, and a decline in quality of life. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA), an intermediate-acting synthetic glucocorticoid, is widely used as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. However, its clinical application faces challenges such as rapid clearance from the joint cavity following intra-articular (IA) administration, the risk of joint damage with repeated injections, and the invasive nature of the IA injection route. To address these drawbacks, we propose sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), a biocompatible matrix, as a promising strategy for sustained drug release via intramuscular (IM) injection. Building on this approach, we designed a gallic acid-modified triamcinolone acetonide derivative (TA-GA) and incorporated it into the SAIB matrix to create the TA-GA-SAIB depot. The modification of TA with gallic acid (GA) effectively mitigates the burst release commonly observed in SAIB formulations, attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions between TA-GA and the SAIB matrix. Benzyl alcohol (BA) was selected as the optimal solvent to achieve minimal burst release during the in vitro drug release study. The TA-GA-SAIB depot exhibited sustained in vivo drug release, enhanced anti-inflammatory effects, and significant improvement in cartilage damage, along with excellent safety and biocompatibility. The synergy between the SAIB matrix and TA-GA not only enables sustained drug release but also improves therapeutic efficacy, making it a promising system for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis via intramuscular administration.

AB Irrigation and debridement using an irrigation solution is a fundamental step during the surgical treatment of both acute and chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). However, there is no consensus on the optimal solution, nor is there sufficient evidence on the optimal irrigation time and combination of solutions. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which solution or combination of solutions is most efficacious against biofilm, as well as the optimal irrigation time. We conducted an experimental in vitro model by inoculating stainless steel discs with ATCC strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a clinical strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The discs were all irrigated with commonly used antiseptic solutions (10% and 3% povidone iodine, hydrogen peroxide, 3% acetic acid, and Bactisure (TM)) for 1 min, 3 min, and 5 min and their combinations for 9 min (3 min each) vs. sterile saline as a positive control. We evaluated the reduction in biofilm based on colony-forming unit (cfu) counts and in combination assays, also based on cell viability and scanning electron microscopy. All antiseptics alone reduced more than 90% of cfu counts after 1 min of irrigation; the worst results were for hydrogen peroxide and 3% acetic acid. When solutions were sequentially combined, the best results were observed for all those starting with acetic acid, in terms of both reduction of log cfu/mL counts and viable cells. We consider that a combination of antiseptic solutions, particularly that comprising the sequence acetic acid + povidone iodine + hydrogen peroxide, would be the best option for chemical debridement during PJI surgery.

As part of the development of a simulation model of the automated control system of the local intelligent power system MicroGrid, the results of modeling the exchange of active power of the power connection from the main network of the main South of Russia main electrical networks and the distribution network of the university campus (in which classical sources of generation are combined with solar, wind and hydrogen energy) are presented.In a single model, the electrical mode of operation of networks is simulated in the voltage range of 0.4-500 kV. Simulation is carried out in steady state and transient mode. Slow, real and fast time modes are available. Simulation of emergency control systems has been implemented. The modes of synchronization of the main and distribution networks in normal and emergency circuits are considered. Reliability control and monitoring of the main operating parameters are carried out.The active power exchange module created on the basis of the results of the simulation as part of the software package & DLANGBRAC; RETREN & drangbrac; will make it possible to use this complex to automate the management of local power system. The energy system, in addition to power from the grid, includes gas generation, solar panels installed on the roofs of campus buildings, wind turbines and stationary hydrogen power plants operating on hydrogen fuel cells.

AB Pure titanium is often used in the manufacture of pressure vessels due to its excellent corrosion resistance. Pressure vessels are generally operated in various corrosive media and subjected to varying degrees of corrosion. Stress corrosion cracking is one of the most dangerous forms of damage to pressure vessels used in various fields. Welded joints become the weak link of the pressure vessels because of the uneven microstructure and welding residual stress, which could cause stress corrosion and directly affect the overall performance and service life of pressure vessels. At present, as a method to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties of materials, shot peening has been widely studied. However, shot peening often leads to the increase of surface roughness and even causes defects such as cracks and surface damage, which will affect the effect of improving the corrosion resistance of materials. It remains to be further studied that the specific influence of surface roughness on the stress corrosion resistance of metal materials. In this work, the stress corrosion behavior of the original samples, ultrasonic shot peening (USSP) samples and USSP with surface polished samples of TA2 titanium welded joints in 10%HCI solution were studied by slow strain rate tension (SSRT) experiment. OM, TEM and SEM were used to observe the microstructure and corrosion fracture morphology of the welded joints. The surface roughness and residual stress of different processed samples were measured, and the corrosion mechanisms were analyzed. The results showed that both stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement occurred in pure titanium welded joints in this system, and weld metal (WM) was the weakest link in the welded joint. The stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index (I-scc) of the original sample in this system was 25.61%, indicating a tendency of stress corrosion. The I-scc of the USSP sample was reduced by 28.78%, and that of the USSP with surface polished (1500#) sample was reduced by 53.3%; both of them had no obvious tendency of stress corrosion in the system. The roughness of the USSP surface could cause stress concentration to form a crack source, which was similar to the pitting propagation. USSP with surface polished treatment reduced the surface roughness, achieving the homogenization of the stress distribution and increasing the elongation and the plasticity of the samples, which could further improve the stress corrosion cracking resistance.

AB Here we present a joint experimental -theoretical study on the deposition of imidazole molecules on a Cu(100) surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Surface -enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have been carried out on samples prepared upon deposition of sublimated imidazole molecules in ultra -high vacuum (UHV). Computational studies, performed in the frame of the density functional theory (DFT), include a wide variety of models where the coadsorption of imidazole molecules and dehydrogenated species takes place. The combination of measurements and simulations demonstrates the formation of two types of coating at the metal-organic interface: (i) self -assembled monolayers stabilized through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and (ii) polymeric species with new C-C bonds established between the imidazole units.

AB Due to the moist environment and inevitable movement, efficient wound closure and healing of vulnerable joint skin remains a great challenge. Herein, a poly(gamma-glutamic acid)-crosslinked amino-functionalized PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (gamma-PGA/PEGS-NH2) adhesive hydrogel is reported. PEGS-NH2 and gamma-PGA not only forms covalent amide bonds with biological tissue surfaces to achieve strong moist adhesion but also establishes a stable chemically crosslinked network in bulk hydrogels to resist deformation. Furthermore, bioinspired gallic acid-modified chitosan (CS-GA) is introduced to enhance moist adhesion via multiple hydrogen bonds and establish a dynamic physically crosslinked network to dissipate energy. Consequently, this adhesive hydrogel strongly adheres to moist biological tissue, showing an adhesion six times higher than that of fibrin glue and comparable to that of strong cyanoacrylate glue. Moreover, benefiting from high mechanical resilience and effective energy dissipation, 200 cycles of loading-unloading mechanical tests conducted under an adhesive state and a full-thickness rat skin incision model applied on a dynamic nape further confirmed the desirable dynamic tissue adhesion and wound healing performance. Combining the above ideal features with their good injectability and shape-adaptability to complex contours, such adhesive hydrogels are demonstrated to be promising candidates for joint wound closure and healing in moist and dynamic physiological environment.

AB The hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (HISCC) behavior of SUS301L-MT stainless steel laser-arc hybrid welding (LAHW) joints was investigated using slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) method in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution under different cathodic potentials. With the negative shift of applied potentials from open circle potential (OCP) to -1400 mV(SCE), the HISCC susceptibility index (I-SSRT) decreased from 0.15 (OCP) to 0.06 (-400 mV(SCE)), then increased to 0.28 (-1400 mV(SCE)). The specimens tested in air and under OCP to -800 mV ruptured in weld metal zone with ductile features of dimples. While with the potential turned more negative, the specimens ruptured in base metal zone with brittle features of transgranular cleave in martensite, intergranular failure and secondary cracks.

AB This study investigated the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism of 304L under a glycine environment through electrochemical measurements, soaking test, and slow strain rate tensile test. Results show that the rapidly cooled structure at the weld heat-affected zone has a significantly higher susceptibility to SCC than the open grain structure. Moreover, glycine concentration influences the electrochemical and SCC behaviors of 304L. The corrosion current density, maintaining a passive current density, and susceptibility to SCC of 304L are proportional to glycine concentration. Meanwhile, the SCC on the sensitized structure of 304L is a joint consequence of anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Intergranular AD initiates cracks, whereas the synergistic effect of AD and HE accelerates crack extension.

AB A material with porous structures formed by jointed aza- and oxa-aza-crowns with peripheral OHgroups is synthesized on the basis of cellulose fabric and PVC transformed into hydroxyethylcyclam. Mesopores are mainly observed on the fiber surface. The specific surface of the material is 6 m(2)/g; the volume of free space is 0.112 cm(3)/g. Assuming the internal pores have a disk-like shape, their width is estimated at 2 nm. The material sorbs vapors of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, amides, nitriles, and sulfoxides. It also swells to a limited degree in organic solvents. When sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide is sorbed in the pores, compounds of them with H+- and OH--conducting systems of hydrogen bonds are formed.

AB The balance between softening and hardening is still a great challenge for the laser welding of the high strength low alloy steel. For example, welding with low heat input was commonly used to avoid softening, but it would inversely harden the joint and introduce the undesired welding defects such as hydrogen-induced cracks. This work proposed a simple and robust processing technique, denominated High Frequency electric cooperated Laser Welding. Laser heat source was combined with high-frequency electric heat source to balance heat input distribution and reconcile the contradiction between softening and hardening in the welding of high strength low alloy steel. As a structural material sensitive to welding softening and hardening, S690QL steel was adopted to show the fundamental advancement of the new process. Benefitted from the skin effect and proximity effect of high-frequency current that improve the heat input distribution and the regulation of the high-frequency heat input proportion, the martensite content in the heat affected zone was greatly reduced, whilst the grain size was limited to a low value. Under the high-frequency heat input proportion of 47.1 %, lower bainite distributed throughout the heat affected zone. The softening and hardening issues of the joint therefore have been improved simultaneously: the tensile strength of the joint was almost equal to that of the base material, the impact energy of weld seam and the heat affected zone reached 77.6 J and 66.2 J respectively.

AB The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first-principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential- and pH-dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4x4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by the electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).

AB Silver-doped diamond-like carbon (Ag-DLC) films offer low residual stress, good adhesion, and excellent wear resistance, and thus are promising materials for surface modification of joint prostheses. Further, as proteins are the most abundant component of joint fluid, the wear performance of Ag-DLC films in protein environments warrants investigation. We prepared DLC and 10.0 at.% Ag-DLC films using hybrid deposition technique by combining high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering and high-power pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The wear performance of the films was tested using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. A biofilm of denatured proteins formed at the friction interface of the Ag-DLC film, which improve wear resistance. Subsequent protein adsorption, Ag+ ions release, and spectroscopic evaluation of the interaction between Ag+ ions and BSA molecules revealed the mechanism of biofilm formation. Ag doping promoted the protein adsorption on film surface and friction interface of Ag-DLC films. Meanwhile, Ag-DLC films released Ag+ ions when exposed in physiological solutions. The released Ag+ ions break the hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds in proteins and transform the alpha-helix structure to beta-sheet and beta-turn structure, thus unfolding the protein, exposing the inner hydrophobic groups, and inducing protein deposition and biofilm formation. The study elucidates the biofilm formation mechanism at the friction interface of Ag-DLC films and counterparts and can aid in design of hardwearing joint implants.

AB The need to significantly reduce emissions from the steelmaking sector requires effective and ready-to-use technical solutions. With this aim, different decarbonization strategies have been investigated by both researchers and practitioners. To this concern, the most promising pathway is represented by the replacement of natural gas with pure hydrogen in the direct reduced iron (DRI) production process to feed an electric arc furnace (EAF). This solution allows to significantly reduce direct emissions of carbon dioxide from the DRI process but requires a significant amount of electricity to power electrolyzers adopted to produce hydrogen. The adoption of renewable electricity sources (green hydrogen) would reduce emissions by 95-100% compared to the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. In this work, an analytical model for the identification of the minimum emission configuration of a green energy-steel system consisting of a secondary route supported by a DRI production process and a renewable energy conversion system is proposed. In the model, both technological features of the hydrogen steel plant and renewable energy production potential of the site where it is to be located are considered. Compared to previous studies, the novelty of this work consists of the joint modeling of a renewable energy system and a steel plant. This allows to optimize the overall system from an environmental point of view, considering the availability of green hydrogen as an inherent part of the model. Numerical experiments proved the effectiveness of the model proposed in evaluating the suitability of using green hydrogen in the steelmaking process. Depending on the characteristics of the site and the renewable energy conversion system adopted, decreases in emissions ranging from 60% to 91%, compared to the BF-BOF route, were observed for the green energy-steel system considered It was found that the environmental benefit of using hydrogen in the secondary route is strictly related to the national energy mix and to the electrolyzers' technology. Depending on the reference context, it was found that there exists a maximum value of the emission factor from the national electricity grid below which is environmentally convenient to produce DRI by using only hydrogen. It was moreover found that the lower the electricity consumption of the electrolyzer, the higher the value assumed by the emission factor from the electricity grid, which makes the use of hydrogen convenient.

AB Zr-4 alloy is widely used as fuel cladding in the nuclear industry. And welding is one of the most significant procedures during the manufacturing of fuel assembly. Bonding at high temperature risks safe operation of nuclear reactors because high temperature deteriorates the properties of Zr-4 alloy. Herein, Zr-4 alloy was hydrogenated to a hydrogen content of 0.2 wt.% before diffusion bonding. Direct diffusion bonding of hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy was performed at various bonding temperatures. The microstructural evolution of the bonding interface and the interface bonding mechanism were systematically investigated. The bonding temperature of the hydrogenated Zr-4 alloy was reduced by 150 degrees C compared with the corresponding nonhydrogenated alloy. Furthermore, the shear strength of the joints was as high as 257 MPa (4.6 x higher than corresponding joints comprised of the non-hydrogenated alloy) at a bonding temperature of 700 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction indicate that plastic deformation of the joints increased because of a phase transition of the hydrides (to the b-Zr phase) during bonding, leading to high-density dislocations that accumulated at the bonding interface. The migration of the interface grain boundary was facilitated by high-density dislocations of sufficiently high energy. The bonding interface was no longer evident, enabled by dynamic recrystallization induced by migration of the interface grain boundary. Furthermore, the fracture mode of the joints was initially brittle but became ductile/brittle mixed mode with increasing temperature.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The aggregation behaviors of a series of heterogemini surfactants N,N-dimethyl-N-[3-(alkyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-alkylammonium bromide, abbreviated as CmOhpNCn (m, n = 10, 8; 10, 14; 12, 8; 12, 10; 12, 12; 12, 14; 14, 8 and 14, 10), have been investigated in aqueous solution. Electric conductivity, steady-state and frequency sweep rheological measurements were adopted to study the micellar morphology affected by molecular structure, concentration and temperature, and a close relationship among them was established. Electric conductivity measurement results indicated that Krafft temperatures were mainly related to the total number of carbon atoms, while the CMC values were affected by the combined factors of alkyl chain length, degree of dissymmetry and hydroxyl head group. And some unusual values may come from the poor water solubility induced by the relatively long alkyl chain n. Dynamic rheological results and cryo-TEM images revealed various micellar behaviors of C-mOhpNC-8 affected by different combined factors. When m value was increased, the formation of quite long rodlike or wormlike micelles derived from the enhanced hydrophobility and hydrogen bonding. And the effect of concentration on aggregation behavior was similar to that of m value except for formation of micellar joints. With temperature increase, the decreased viscosity of C(14)OhpNC(8) was due to formation of micellar joints and weakening of hydrogen bonding, which could be confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, the C(14)OhpNC(8) aggregates formed below the Krafft temperature were more likely to be affected by temperature at high concentrations.

AB The joint process of pyrolysis-steam reforming is a novel and promising strategy for hydrogen production from biomass; however, it is conditioned by the endothermicity of the reforming reaction and the fast catalyst deactivation. Oxygen addition may potentially overcome these limitations. A thermodynamic equilibrium approach using Gibbs free energy minimization method has been assumed for the evaluation of suitable conditions for the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of biomass fast pyrolysis volatiles. The simulation has been carried out contemplating a wide range of reforming operating conditions, i.e., temperature (500-800 degrees C), steam/biomass (S/B) ratio (0-4) and equivalence ratio (ER) (0-0.2). It is to note that the simulation results under steam reforming (SR) conditions are consistent with those obtained by experiments. Temperatures between 600 and 700 degrees C, S/B ratios in the 2-3 range and ER values of around 0.12 are the optimum conditions for the OSR under autothermal reforming (ATR) conditions, as they allow attaining high hydrogen yields (10 wt% by mass unit of the biomass in the feed), which are only 12-15% lower than those obtained under SR conditions.

AB Objective: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative joint condition, leading to disability and diminished quality of life. Molecular hydrogen has been proven to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but few studies have investigated its effects on osteoarthritis. Our study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of hydrogen-oxygen mixture (H2-O2) inhalation for KOA. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, eligible elderly KOA patients were randomly assigned to either Group H or Group C. Both groups participated in a 12-week home-based exercise (HBE) program, which included knee-joint exercises and health education. Group H additionally received H2-O2 inhalation for 60 min per day over 2 weeks, while Group C did not. The primary outcome was measured using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included inflammation levels (hs-CRP, NLR, PLR, LMR), Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), and adverse events. Results: A total of 121 subjects were enrolled, with an average age of 81.2 years, and 80.2% were female. The between-group mean difference in the WOMAC total score was -5.2 (95% CI -12.1 to 1.7, P = 0.140) at week 12, with Group H showing an improvement of -22.9 (95% CI -26.3 to -19.6, P < 0.001) and Group C showing an improvement of -19.4 (95% CI -22.7 to -16.0, P < 0.001) compared to baseline, revealing a significant group x time interaction (F (3, 356.034) = 14.425, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between both groups at week 12 in CST, TUG, SF-36 scores, EARS scores, or the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: Although clinical significance was not achieved, H2-O2 inhalation alleviated KOA symptoms and enhanced functional activity in elderly patients undergoing the HBE program during the initial 2 weeks. However, its sustained effects on improving KOA symptoms were not observed.

AB The intergalactic helium became fully ionized by the end of cosmic noon (z similar to 2). Similarly to the reionization of hydrogen, helium reionization is expected to be patchy, driven by luminous quasars that ionize the intergalactic gas in their surrounding environment. Probing the morphology of ionized electrons during this epoch can provide crucial information about early structure formation, including the clustering and luminosities of quasars, the accretion rates, variability, and lifetimes of active galactic nuclei, as well as the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. In this study, we present how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to reconstruct the optical-depth fluctuations resulting from patchy helium reionization. As helium reionization occurred at lower redshifts, upcoming probes of large-scale structure surveys will present a significant opportunity to enhance the prospects of probing this epoch by their combined analysis with the CMB. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of hydrogen and helium reionization, we show that near-future galaxy and CMB surveys will have enough statistical power to detect optical-depth fluctuations due to doubly-ionized helium, providing a way of measuring the redshift and duration of helium reionization to high significance. We also show that modeling uncertainties in helium reionization can impact the measurement precision of parameters characterizing hydrogen reionization.

AB Based on CoVs, the genomic structure is arranged in a +ssRNA with approximately 30 kb in length which is the biggest known RNA viruses including a 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail. CoVs, (positive stranded RNA viruses), can infect humans and multiple species of animals, cause enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system diseases in many species. These viruses are important for anti-CoV drug delivery through a pivotal function in viral gene expression and replication through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins. In this paper, it has been illustrated the linkage of 6 inhibitors of N4[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide, "inh1", NSC 158362, "inh2", JMF 1586 ,"inh3",(N-(2-aminoethyl)-1-1 zirid ine-ethanamine) , "inh4" ,[(Z)-1-thiophen-2ylethylideneamino]thiourea, "inh5" and Vanillinbananin, "inh6", to CoVs by forming the complexes of "inhibitor- CoV" in water phase through the H-bonding using some physico-chemical properties including heat of formation , Gibbs free energy , electronic energy , charge distribution of active parts in the hydrogen bonding ,NMR estimation of inhibitor jointed to the database amino acids fragment of Tyr-Met-His as the selective zone of the CoV, positive frequency and intensity of different normal modes of these structures.The theoretical calculations were done at various levels of theory in water simulated medium to gain the more accurate equilibrium geometrical results, and infrared spectral data for each of the complex proposed drugs of N-terminal or O-terminal auto-cleavage substrate were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of six inhibitors including jointed to TMH, inh[1-6]-TMH. A comparison of these structures with two configurations provides new insights for the design of substrate-based inhibitors targeting CoV. This indicates a feasible model for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoV-associated diseases.The structure-based optimization of these structures has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N and O atoms through forming the hydrogen bonding (hydrogen-bonding) with potent inhibition against CoV (Tyr160-Met161-His162) because of water polar medium which has been abbreviated as TMH in this paper.

AB This study has investigated the joint effect of several mix parameters on the properties of foam geopolymers. The mix parameters analysed through a laboratory experiment of 54 different mortar mixes were, sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide mass ratio (2.5, 3.5, 4.5), activator/binder mass ratio (0.6, 0.8, 1.0), chemical foaming agent type (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium perborate (NaBO3)) and foaming agent mass ratio content (1%, 2%, 3%). Properties, SEM and FTIR analysis and cost analysis are included. The results show that the sodium perborate over performs hydrogen peroxide leading to a lower overall thermal conductibility of foam geopolymers. Mixtures with a low thermal conductivity of around 0.1 W/(m.K) and a compressive strength of around 6 MPa were achieved. The cost analysis show that the foaming agents are responsible for a small percentage of foam geopolymers total cost being that the alkaline activators are responsible for more than 80%.

AB Precise characterization of archetypal systems of aqueous hydrogen-bonding networks is essential for developing accurate potential functions and universal models of water. The structures of water clusters (H2O)(n) (n = 2-9) have been verified recently through size-specific infrared spectroscopy with a vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser (VUV-FEL) and quantum chemical studies. For (H2O)(10), the pentagonal prism and butterfly motifs were proposed to be important building blocks and were observed in previous experiments. Here we report the size-specific infrared spectra of (H2O)(10) via a joint experimental and theoretical study. Well-resolved spectra provide a unique signature for the coexistence of pentagonal prism and butterfly motifs. These (H2O)(10) motifs develop from the dominant structures of (H2O)(n) (n = 8, 9) clusters. This work provides an intriguing prelude to the diverse structure of liquid water and opens avenues for size-dependent measurement of larger systems to understand the stepwise formation mechanism of hydrogen-bonding networks.

AB Ammonia is not only the most important chemical for fertilizer production, it has also gained much interest as a future hydrogen storage material. Besides the well-known Haber-Bosch process to generate ammonia from elemental sources, new ways to convert nitrogen into ammonia have been investigated in the last decade for a decentralized production, including electrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches. However, photocatalysis in particular suffers from stagnating materials development and unstandardized reaction conditions. In this Review, we shine light on recent materials and reaction engineering results for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction, putting an emphasis on the need to connect the activity of reported materials together with detailed reaction conditions and efficiencies. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction is an emerging field that will certainly gain significant interest in the future as a sustainable pathway to generate green hydrogen and ammonia. The field will certainly strongly benefit from joint efforts with strong interactions between chemists, physicists and chemical engineers at a fundamental level.

AB This study systematically investigates the fracture behavior of X80 pipeline steel welded joints under hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) conditions through combined experimental characterization and numerical simulation. Microstructural observations and Vickers hardness testing reveal significant heterogeneity in the base metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and weld metal (WM), resulting in spatially non-uniform mechanical properties. A user-defined subroutine (USDFLD) was employed to assign continuous material property distributions within the finite element model, accurately capturing mechanical heterogeneity and its influence on crack-tip mechanical fields and crack propagation paths. Results show that welding thermal cycles induce pronounced microstructural evolution, significantly altering hardness and strength distributions, which in turn affect the evolution of crack-tip stress and plastic strain fields. Crack propagation preferentially occurs toward regions of higher yield strength, where limited plasticity leads to intensified crack-tip stress concentration, accelerating crack growth and extending propagation paths. Moreover, crack growth is accompanied by local unloading near the crack tip, reducing peak stress and strain compared to the initial stationary crack tip. The stress and strain field reconfiguration are primarily localized near the crack tip, while the far-field mechanical response remains largely stable.

AB This study develops a Janus-structured hydrogel sensor (P(AA-co-PNIPAM/CDs)) through template-assisted copolymerization of acrylic acid and N-isopropylacrylamide with dopamine-cellulose carbon dots (CDs). The hydrogel demonstrates temperature-responsive strain sensing regulation and enhanced interfacial adhesion, achieving remarkable peel strengths of 237.8 N m-1 (air, 25 degrees C) and 42.7 N m-1 (water, 50 degrees C). CD incorporation improves conductivity (1.219 mS cm-1) while reinforcing dynamic adhesion through hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions. The dual-responsive hydrogel exhibits exceptional joint motion monitoring capabilities across diverse environments, maintaining a stable electrical signal output during repetitive stretching (100% strain). Its temperature-modulated underwater adhesion and strain-sensitive conductivity enable the precise detection of both macroscopic movements (joint flexion) and subtle physiological signals (pulse waves). These synergistic properties position P(AA-co-PNIPAM/CDs) as a promising candidate for next-generation smart sensors in athletic monitoring and aquatic robotics, particularly in addressing challenges in underwater wearable electronics and adaptive human-machine interfaces.

AB The effects of various organic additives, such as diethanolamine (DEA) and ethanolamine (EA), and variations in aging times on the formation and stability mechanisms of spherical aggregates of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by using solvothermal synthesis were studied. The experimental results of the structural, morphological and optical properties monitored by using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and UV-Vis spectroscopy were supported by quantum chemical calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Understanding the mechanism of spherical ZnO aggregate formation and its stability by mimicking the processes at the computer level was achieved through theoretical simulations of the ZnO surface/additive interactions using (ZnO)(36)-DEA and (ZnO)(36)-EA models. The fine-tuned spherical aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles was driven by various interactions, in particular, strong O-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O and weak N-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bonds as controlling interactions. The calculated negative free release energy, increment G*(INT), indicates that the ZnO surface/additive interaction in diethanolamine media is a spontaneous exergonic process ( increment G*(INT) = -7.73 kcal mol(-1)), whereas, in ethanolamine media, it is an unfavorable, slightly endergonic process ( increment G*(INT) > 0). The presence of two strong O-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bonds and, at the same time, a weaker N-H & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;O hydrogen bond is the key factor for the very good and long-term aggregate stability of ZnO NPs in DEA media. This integrated experimental-theoretical study highlights the stability and compactness of spherical ZnO aggregates of ZnO NPs, prepared in the presence of diethanolamine compared to ethanolamine media, and provides a promising method and flexible design of ZnO nanomaterials to improve their adsorptive and optical properties.

AB The main objective of the study was to assess if joint application of melatonin (MT, 0.1 mM) and salicylic acid (SA 0.5 mM) could improve tolerance of pepper plants to arsenic (As) as sodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate (0.05 mM). The imposition of arsenic stress led to accumulation of As in roots and leaves, and increased contents of leaf proline, phytochelatins, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2, but it reduced plant biomass, chlorophylls (Chl), PSII maximum efficiency (Fv/Fm) and leaf water potential. Melatonin and SA applied jointly or alone enhanced nitrogen metabolism by triggering the activities of glutamate synthase, glutamine synthetase, and nitrite reductases and nitrate. In comparison with a single treatment of MT or SA, the joint treatment of MT and SA had better impact on enhancing growth and key biological events and decreasing tissue As content. This clearly shows a cooperative function of both agents in enhancing tolerance to As-toxicity in pepper plants.

AB A major goal of energy research is to use visible light to cleave water directly, without an applied voltage, into hydrogen and oxygen. Although SrTiO3 requires ultraviolet light, after four decades, it is still the "gold standard" for the photo-catalytic splitting of water. It is chemically robust and can carry out both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions without an applied bias. While ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques have provided useful insights, we still know relatively little about the structure of these electrodes in contact with electrolytes under operating conditions. Here, we report the surface structure evolution of a n-SrTiO3 electrode during water splitting, before and after "training" with an applied positive bias. Operando high-energy X-ray reflectivity measurements demonstrate that training the electrode irreversibly reorders the surface. Scanning electrochemical microscopy at open circuit correlates this training with a 3-fold increase of the activity toward the photo-induced water splitting. A novel first-principles joint density functional theory simulation, constrained to the X-ray data via a generalized penalty function, identifies an anatase-like structure as the more active, trained surface.

TI Collaborative scheduling and benefit allocation for waste-to-energy,

   energy system; temporal relevance; Improved aumann-shapley value method
AB Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a technology that converts inexhaustible waste into electricity, thus significantly alleviating energy crisis. Integrating hydrogen storage into WTE provides an effective way to store and utilize surplus electricity from WTE on-site (by producing hydrogen). Additionally, integrating power-to-gas (P2G) into WTE provides an effective way to reduce CO2 emission from WTE on-site (by producing natural gas). To this end, a novel waste-driven renewable energy system (WRES), which is consisted of WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G, has been proposed. However, the uncertain waste supply and electrical load markedly interfere with WRES operation. Meanwhile, when WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G belong to different agents, the collaborative benefit from WRES operation should be rationally allocated among agents for system sustainability. This paper endeavors to achieve WRES scheduling and collaborative benefit allocation for WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G under uncertainties. Firstly, a temporal relevance based distributionally robust optimization model is proposed for WRES scheduling under uncertainties, in which the possible range of the joint distribution for uncertainties is depicted by data covariance matrices involved ambiguity set. Secondly, collaborative benefit is allocated according to WTE, hydrogen storage, and P2G contributions, in which Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula is integrated with Aumann-Shapley value method to reduce calculation complexity. Finally, simulation results show that 1) the proposed scheduling model guarantees the economic and stable operation of WRES under uncertainties. 2) after considering the temporal relevance, WRES operation benefit is 8.35 % higher, which indicates that the proposed scheduling model has superiority in decision conservatism by introducing temporal relevance to remove impractical distributions in ambiguity set. 3) the proposed allocation model rationally distributes the collaborative benefit according to contributions, and presents lower calculation complexity, e.g., the calculation time is 95.52 % lower than the Shapely value method. This paper provides policy insights to promote widespread application and sustainable operation of WRES.

AB The 1:1 complex of tert-butyl alcohol with difluoromethane has been characterized by means of a joint experimental-computational investigation. Its rotational spectrum has been recorded by using a pulsed jet Fourier-Transform microwave spectrometer. The experimental work has been guided and supported by accurate quantum-chemical calculations. In particular, the computed potential energy landscape pointed out the formation of three stable isomers. However, the very low interconversion barriers explain why only one isomer, showing one O-H center dot center dot center dot F and two C-H center dot center dot center dot O weak hydrogen bonds, has been experimentally characterized. The effect of the H tert-butyl-group substitution has been analyzed from the comparison to the difluoromethane-water adduct. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Neutron crystallography is a powerful method to determine the positions of H atoms in macromolecular structures. However, it is sometimes hard to judge what would constitute a chemically reasonable model, and the geometry of H atoms depends more on the surroundings (for example the formation of hydrogen bonds) than heavy atoms, so that the empirical geometry information for the H atoms used to supplement the experimental data is often less accurate. These problems may be reduced by using quantum-mechanical calculations. A method has therefore been developed to combine quantum-mechanical calculations with joint crystallographic refinement against X-ray and neutron data. A first validation of this method is provided by re-refining the structure of the galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex with lactose. The geometry is improved, in particular for water molecules, for which the method leads to better-resolved hydrogen-bonding interactions. The method has also been applied to the active copper site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and shows that the protonation state of the amino-terminal histidine residue can be determined.

AB The effects of micro-mixer pattern, volumetric flow ratio, capillary length, inner diameter of capillary, residence time, and phenol concentration on phenol microfluidic extraction were investigated. The results indicated that the extraction performances of phenol with Y-shape joint were higher than that with T-shape joint. The smaller inner diameter of capillary could improve extraction performances of phenol. The phenol concentration of the inlet in aqueous phase had slight influence on phenol microfluidic extraction. The inner diameter of capillary of 1.0 mm, volumetric flow ratio of 1:1, capillary length of 2 m, and residence time of 88.3 s were more suitable for extraction of phenol. The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient of phenol reached 0.0036 s-1 at residence time of 8.8 s. The extraction efficiency of phenol realized 99% at residence time of 23.6 s. The extraction of phenol from aqueous solution depended on intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds between MIBK and phenol.

AB A joint protection system is proposed, replace the auxiliary anode in impressed current cathodic protection with DSA anode with chlorine evolution ability, and perform electrolytic seawater antifouling while performing impressed current cathodic protection. The results of electrochemical impedance tests are used in conjunction with the relationship between the material hardness and degree of hydrogen embrittlement to determine that the cathodic protection potential range is -0.85 V- -1.17 V (vs. SCE). An effective chlorine detection electrode is used to detect the concentration and diffusion of effective chlorine in the anode region of the combined protection system, where the potential range for chlorine production by the anode is 1.85 V-2 V (vs. SCE). The anode and cathode potentials are adjusted to conduct a comparative experiment on corrosion and biological adhesion on the surface of Q345 carbon steel treated with joint protection in marine environments. The surface morphology of the experimental samples is analyzed. The experimental results reveal joint protection prevents corrosion of the surface of the Q345 carbon steel as well as fouling or biological attachment. A white calcium-magnesium deposition layer forms on the substrate surface. For the Q345 carbon steel treated with ICCP alone, there are very clear signs of biological adhesion on the surface, the substrate under the deposition layer is clearly corroded, and the deposition layer appears yellow because of the adhesion of a large quantity of organic matter. A comparative analysis of the experimental results leads to the conclusion that the combined application of electrolytic seawater antifouling and ICCP to Q345 carbon steel can simultaneously prevent electrochemical corrosion and marine fouling by biological adhesion.

AB Hydrogels have broad application prospects in biomedicine, energy, and tissue engineering due to their high water content, adjustable physicochemical properties, and flexibility. In general, the poor stretchability and adhesion of hydrogels limit their application in flexible wearable electronics. In this work, a composite hydrogel (GM hydrogel) with excellent adhesion, stretchability, and conductivity was prepared by a one-pot synthesis process through the hydrogen-bonding interaction between P(AM-co-AA)) and gallic acid (GA). Natural plant polyphenol GA not only enhances the mechanical properties of the hydrogel (maximum tensile strain of 890% and maximum tensile stress of 238 kPa) but also gives the hydrogel adhesion (9 kPa). GM hydrogel can be further used to construct strain sensors and self-powered sensors. GM hydrogel strain sensors can be attached to finger joints to monitor and distinguish the angles of finger joint bending. Self-powered sensors based on GM hydrogels can stably transmit encrypted signals. Therefore, multifunctional GM hydrogels can be used for electronic skin, human motion monitoring, and wearable biosensors.

AB Osteoarthritis patients often experience pain and inflammation in joints. To understand whether antioxidant supplements could reduce inflammation and could potentially be applied for osteoarthritis treatment, vitamin E and resveratrol were investigated in this study. Hydrogen peroxide was used for inducing inflammation in porcine chondrocytes, and the lumen density was measured for the level of oxygen-derived free radicals. In total, 5, 50, 100, and 200 mu M of vitamin E and resveratrol were analyzed for cell viability and the effect of lumen density. In addition, the expressions of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, MMP-1, MMP-13, and COL2A1 were investigated when treating chondrocytes with 100 mu M vitamin E, 5 mu M resveratrol, or their combination before or after hydrogen peroxide induction. Inducing chondrocytes with hydrogen peroxide for 30 min increased the level of lumen density sufficiently and stimulated the expression of inflammatory genes. All the concentrations of vitamin E and resveratrol showed good cell viability. Single treatment with either vitamin E or resveratrol reduced inflammatory gene expression, and combined treatment increased the expression of collagen type II. The results suggested that post-treatment with both vitamin E and resveratrol has a better effect on the reduction in inflammation in osteoarthritis-like chondrocytes.

AB Considering the specific wind and photovoltaic power characteristics of a certain region, this study investigates the optimal ratio of Alkaline Electrolysis Cells (AEL) to Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers in a hybrid electrolysis system for hydrogen production. A flexible model for configuring the hybrid electrolysis system is proposed, based on a copula function for joint wind and solar power modeling. This model generates wind and photovoltaic power generation scenarios using the copula function, incorporating a selection mechanism to ensure that the output scenarios are more representative of the actual data characteristics of wind and photovoltaic power output. Consequently, considering both the fluctuation and amplitude, the wind and photovoltaic power data are decomposed using the Ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. The decomposed components are then allocated to the two types of electrolyzers. Furthermore, the optimal configuration of the hybrid electrolysis system is determined by minimizing the costs associated with wasted power, electricity purchases, and other expenses. Finally, a case study of a 100 MW wind farm and a 50 MW photovoltaic power station in Northwest China is presented, concluding that the optimal configuration ratio of AEL to PEM electrolyzers is 2:1. In a Matlab/Simulink platform, the performance metrics of the hybrid electrolysis system were validated. It was found that the hydrogen production rate of the hybrid electrolyzer is comparable to that of the PEM electrolyzer, but with a lower required cost. Additionally, the hydrogen production rate and volume of the optimal configuration for the hybrid electrolyzer determined by the model proposed in this paper are higher than those obtained through the optimization algorithm's optimal configuration.

AB The influences of caffeine, lysozyme and the joint application of them on the hepatoma cell line HepG2 proliferation inhibition and cell apoptosis were observed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and Hoechst 33342, which showed the proliferation inhibition rate of the joint application on HepG2 cells was 47.21%, significantly higher than caffeine or lysozyme, and the joint application promoted the apoptosis of HepG2 cells obviously. Van't Hoff classical thermodynamics formula, the Foster theory of non radiation energy transfer and fluorescence phase diagram were used to manifest that the process of lysozyme binding to caffeine followed a two-state model, which was spontaneous at low temperature driven by enthalpy change, and the predominant intermolecular force was hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals force to stabilize caffeine-lysozyme complex with the distance 5.86 nm. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that caffeine decreased the relative contents of alpha-helix and beta-turn, which inferred the structure of lysozyme tended to be "loose". Synchronous fluorescence spectra and ultraviolet spectra supported the above conclusion. The amino acid residues in the cleft of lysozyme were exposed and electropositivity was increased attributing to the loose structure, which were conducive to increasing caffeine concentration on the HepG2 cell surface by electrostatic interaction to show synergistic effect.

AB Expansion joint failure is one of the main causes that lead to the damages of concrete pavement. The silicon dioxide/shape memory polyurethane (SiO2/SMPU) is a new kind of sealant which can use its shape memory performance to adapt to the width of the expansion joint with the change of pavement temperature, and it can effectively prolong the service life of the pavement and reduce maintenance costs. In this study, the effects of programming and the addition of SiO2 particles to the thermodynamic properties of the specimens were detected using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the optimal shape memory programming temperature of which is 72.9 degrees C. Combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and shape memory effect test, the particles are evenly distributed between the two phases, and the shape fixation rate (R-f) of 98.15% and the shape recovery rate (R-r) of 97.31% show that the composite has a good shape memory effect. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic infrared dichroism illustrate the change of the hydrogen bond of soft and hard segments with the SiO2 particles in the shape memory cycle, revealing the optimal shape memory programming process. This study provides an insight into the reinforcement mechanism of SiO2 nanoparticles in SMPU matrix and verify whether it can meet the engineering requirements of expansion joints when used as a sealant of concrete pavement.

AB In this work, the dynamic behavior of glass transition in a miscible blend of Poly (vinyl phenol) (PVPh)/ Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) with a mass ratio of 3:1 (PVPh/PEO 75/25) were studied within a joint way of experimental and theoretical methods. The results showed the evidence for the influence of hydrogen bonding (HB) and Van der Waals (VdW) interaction between PVPh and PEO on the dynamic behavior in glass transition. The results reported here allows the opportunities for finding new blend dependent on this kind of interaction or design of special polymers to enhance such interactions.

AB We report the size-dependent activity and stability of supported Pt-1,Pt-4,Pt-7,Pt-8 for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size-dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (2 H/Pt). An ensemble-based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential- and adsorbate-coverage-dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.

AB Background: Facet joint degeneration (FJD), which is also called facet joint syndrome (FJS), has become one of the most commonly seen etiological factors for lumbago. Cartilage lesion triggered by lumbar facet joint (LFJ) degeneration might be related to mitochondria! impairment, but the its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Materials and methods: The endplate chondrocytes were induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic the pathological conditions of oxidative stress. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for the evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) level was assessed using ATP detection, along with the detection the expression of cytochrome C in mitochondria (mito-cyt c) and in cell cytoplasm (cyto-cyt c) and cleaved caspase 3 by Western blot analysis. TUNEL assay was conducted for the measurement of cell apoptosis in endplate chondrocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the expression of heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) and the transfection efficiency of HSP22 interference plasmid. Results. It was found that H2O2 promoted the mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation and cell apoptosis in endplate chondrocytes. Moreover, HSP22 was down-regulated in H2O2 -induced endplate chondrocytes, and interference of HSP22 decreased the ROS production, increased the ATP level and promoted the cell apoptosis, resulting in the enhanced impairment of endplate chondrocytes. Additionally, mitochondrial ROS inhibitor (Mito-TEMPO) ameliorated the injury effects of HSP22 silencing in the H2O2 -induced endplate chondrocytes. Conclusion: In conclusion, HSP22 inhibits oxidative stress-induced endplate chondrocyte apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial pathway, possibly providing novel guidance direction for the treatment of LFJ degeneration.

AB Scalable and sustainable solar hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting requires extremely active and stable light-harvesting semiconductors to fulfill the stringent requirements of suitable energy band position and rapid interfacial charge transfer process. Motivated by this point, increasing attention has been given to the development of photocatalysts comprising intimately interfaced photoabsorbers and cocatalysts. Herein, a simple one-step approach is reported to fabricate a high-efficiency photocatalytic system, in which single-site dispersed iron atoms are rationally integrated on the intrinsic structure of the porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer. A detailed analysis of the formation process shows that a stable complex is generated by spontaneously coordinating dicyandiamidine nitrate with iron ions in isopropanol, thus leading to a relatively complicated polycondensation reaction upon thermal treatment. The correlation of experimental and computational results confirms that optimized electronic structures of Fe@g-C3N4 with an appropriate d-band position and negatively shifting Fermi level can be achieved, which effectively gains the reducibility of electrons and creates more active sites for the photocatalytic reactions. As a result, the Fe@g-C3N4 exhibits a highlighted intramolecular synergistic effect, performing greatly enhanced solar-photon-driven activities, including excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (3390 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), lambda > 420 nm) and a reliable apparent quantum efficiency value of 6.89% at 420 nm.

AB The rotational spectrum of the binary adduct of formamide (HCONH2) with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) has been investigated employing cavity-based Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy combined with theoretical computations. Experimentally, only one isomer of the adduct was unambiguously observed and assigned according to the theoretically predicted spectroscopic parameters, and its rotational spectrum displays the hyperfine splittings associated with the N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling effect. The observed isomer exhibits C s symmetry, such that the LCSC angle of the DMS subunit is bisected by the ab-plane of the HCONH2 moiety. The two moieties in the detected isomer are connected via one primary N-H center dot center dot center dot S and two secondary C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), non-covalent interaction (NCI), natural bond orbital (NBO) and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) approaches were utilized for characterizing the intermolecular interactions occurring in the titled adduct. Additionally, the adduct of HCONH2 with dimethyl ether (DME) was also theoretically investigated to compare the difference in structure and energy characteristics between the N-H center dot center dot center dot S and N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds.

AB Hydrogen sensors combining wide detection range and high response, that can operate at room temperature, are urgently demanded for monitoring different concentrations of hydrogen on a single device. Here, a novel onestep hydrothermal method is reported to construct Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 heterophase junctions for a highly sensitive H-2 sensor. The Nb concentration in the solvent plays an important role for the heterophase juncton self-assemble, and the reaction time determines the surface morphology giving either a ruffle TiO2 nanorod decorated anatase form, or a Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 bi-layer structure. An inverse dependence of the detectivity on H-2 concentration is obtained as theoretically predicted but previously not experimentally verified for the high concentration region at low temperatures. The H-2 concentration detection range is remarkably expanded, extending from 1 ppm to 12000 ppm for nanorod decorated film. The H-2 response at 1 ppm is significantly enhanced to 22.5%, and reaches 98.9% in 8000 ppm H-2 for the bilayer structure. The remarkablely extended detection range is the result of the massive accumulation of reactive pre-absorbed O-2(-) on the surface due to the Nb doping, and the significantly enhanced response at room temperature results from the joint contributions of pre-absorbed O-2(-), film compactness and the heterophase junction. Moreover, Nb doped rutile/anatase TiO2 heterophase juncton films show high stability and humidity resistance for hydrogen sensing.

AB Bonding evolution theory (BET), as a combination of the electron localization function (ELF) and Thoms catastrophe theory (CT), has been coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method in order to study biochemical reaction paths. The evolution of the bond breaking/forming processes and electron pair rearrangements in an inhomogeneous dynamic environment provided by the enzyme has been elucidated. The proposed methodology is applied in an enzymatic system in order to clarify the reaction mechanism for the hydrogen abstraction of the androstenedione (ASD) substrate catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 aromatase enzyme. The use of a QM/MM Hamiltonian allows inclusion of the polarization of the charges derived from the amino acid residues in the wave function, providing a more accurate and realistic description of the chemical process. The hydrogen abstraction step is found to have five different ELF structural stability domains, whereas the C-H breaking and O-H forming bond process rearrangements are taking place in an asynchronous way.

AB A joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the valence-shell excitations of hydrogen has been performed by the high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering and electron scattering as well as the multireference single- and double-excitation configuration-interaction method. Momentum-transfer-dependent inelastic squared form factors for the vibronic series belonging to the B (1)Sigma(+)(u), C (1)Pi(u), and E F (1)Sigma(+)(g) electronic states of molecular hydrogen have been derived from the inelastic x-ray scattering method at an impact photon energy around 10 keV, and the electron energy-loss spectra measured at an incident electron energy of 1500 eV. It is found that both the present and the previous calculations cannot satisfactorily reproduce the inelastic squared form-factor profiles for the higher vibronic transitions of the B (1)Sigma(+)(u) state of molecular hydrogen, which may be due to the electronic-vibrational coupling for the higher vibronic states. For the C (1)Pi(u) state and some vibronic excitations of E F (1)Sigma(+)(g) state, the present experimental results are in good agreement with the present and previous calculations, while the slight differences between the inelastic x-ray scattering and electron energy-loss spectroscopy results in the larger squared momentum-transfer region may be attributed to the increasing role of the higher-order Born terms in the electron-scattering process.

AB Although it is widely recognized that even small amounts of hydrogen (H) can cause embrittlement in iron (Fe) and in (high-strength) steels, the fundamental mechanisms that cause it are not yet completely understood. To contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of H in metals, we use parallel replica dynamics (PRD) to study the effect that different amounts of atomic H have in the diffusion of a single vacancy in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe. Using PRD we calculate the diffusion of H-vacancy complexes at temperatures and timescales that are not reachable using classical methods. Additionally, based on the PRD results and calculations of the minimum energy paths of migration, we propose a mechanism for the migration of vacancy-H complexes and formulate an analytical model for the calculation of their joint diffusivity.

AB We report on Bayesian estimation of the radius, mass, and hot surface regions of the massive millisecond pulsar PSR J0740+6620, conditional on pulse-profile modeling of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer X-ray Timing Instrument event data. We condition on informative pulsar mass, distance, and orbital inclination priors derived from the joint North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment/Pulsar wideband radio timing measurements of Fonseca et al. We use XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera spectroscopic event data to inform our X-ray likelihood function. The prior support of the pulsar radius is truncated at 16 km to ensure coverage of current dense matter models. We assume conservative priors on instrument calibration uncertainty. We constrain the equatorial radius and mass of PSR J0740+6620 to be 12.39(-0.98)(+1.30) km and 2.072(-0.066)(+0.067) M-circle dot respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles, conditional on surface hot regions that are non-overlapping spherical caps of fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere with uniform effective temperature; a posteriori, the temperature is log(10)(T[K]) = 5.99(-0.06)(+0.05) for each hot region. All software for the X-ray modeling framework is open-source and all data, model, and sample information is publicly available, including analysis notebooks and model modules in the Python language. Our marginal likelihood function of mass and equatorial radius is proportional to the marginal joint posterior density of those parameters (within the prior support) and can thus be computed from the posterior samples.

AB The vibrational dynamics of the OH stretching mode in Ba(ClO4)(2) trihydrate are investigated by means of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy. The sample offers plane cyclic water trimers in the solid phase that feature virtually no hydrogen bond interaction between the water molecules. Selective excitation of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching leads to fast population redistribution, while simultaneous excitation yields quantum beats, which are monitored via a combination tone that dominates the overtone spectrum. The combination of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical simulations and general theoretical considerations gives indication of various aspects of symmetry breakage. The system shows a joint population lifetime of 8 ps and a long-lived coherence between symmetric and asymmetric stretching, which decays with a time constant of 0.6 ps. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Healthy synovial fluids (SFs) are complex fluids consisting of biopolymers, globule proteins, and lipids and regarded as superlubricants to provide nearly life-long low friction and wear protection of synovial joints in mammals. In this paper, we report that the intricate lubricious mixture can be simulated by the aggregation of hyaluronic acid (HA) and hydrogel particles in aqueous suspensions. In the HA aqueous suspensions added with synthetic polymer microgels, we have effectively captured the bulk rheological properties of healthy SFs. It is also confirmed by light scattering and fluorescence microscopic characterization that added hydrogel particles can enhance the HA network by hydrogel-mediated hydrogen bonding, leading to the fractal HA-hydrogel aggregating networks in aqueous suspensions. The potential application of HA-hydrogel particle aggregates as biomimetic superlubricants is supported by the comparable low friction at high load to that of healthy SFs.

AB Constructing the heterostructure with noble metals on semiconductors is recognized as a prospective approach to enhance hydrogen generation. In this study, Au-Cu2O heterostructure particles (HPs) with unique inter-embedded heterostructures were controllably fabricated by a universal reaction between Cu particles and HAuCl4 solution. Besides, the boosted catalytic performance from the plasmon effects, Au-Cu2O inter-embedded heterostructure exhibits additional structural advantages to promote the photocatalytic property of hydrogen generation overall water splitting. Under the visible light, the H-2 evolution rate of the Au-Cu2O HPs is 152 and 22 times higher than that of pure Cu2O and traditional Cu2O@Au HPs with Au anchored on the surface of Cu2O, respectively. On one hand, inter-embedded heterostructure brings more contact areas as the active sites to carry out the direct electron transfer and electromagnetic transfer for the reduction. On the other hand, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations indicate that enhanced electromagnetic fields of Au-Cu2O HPs form a netlike structure to maximumly accelerate the transfer of hot electrons and separate the electron-hole pairs. Under the joint action of the two, the inter-embed heterostructure exhibits superior photocatalytic property, demonstrating that this study could instruct the design of other metal-semiconductor photocatalysts.

AB In this study, graphite (G) electrode was coated with nickel and decorated with silver nanoparticles (G/Ni/Ag) with the help of galvanostatic method, and electrodes were used as a cathode in alkaline water electrolysis system. The characterization was achieved using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogen evolution performance of electrodes was investigated via cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, cathodic polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance measurements. Electrochemical results showed that hydrogen production efficiency significantly increased and charge transfer resistance decreased via G/Ni/Ag. The electrochemical water splitting performance of G/Ni/Ag, was established in a joint experimental and computational effort. Water and proton adsorption on Ag-decorated Ni surface were investigated using density functional theory. Electronic structure calculations identified the role of Ag adatom and Ni surface on water and proton adsorptions. From the computational studies, O in water was more reliable to adsorb at the bridge position of the Ag and Ni atoms, leading improved orbital overlap between H and Ni atoms and maximized chemical and physical interactions between the H2O molecules. Therefore, the Ag-decorated Ni(111) surface provides preferable adsorption site for the O atom in water and direct interactions between water Hs and available surface Ni atoms promote water dissociation.

AB This paper presents a novel long-term model for the joint expansion planning of power and hydrogen systems with short-term operational considerations. We propose linear reserve constraints with adjustable parameters within the planning model to address the reliability requirements from significant levels of variable renewable generation. These adjustable parameters are calibrated using an iterative training methodology that connects the long-term planning model with a short-term unit commitment model. A crucial aspect of our methodology is the iterative improvement of investment decisions through the feedback obtained by evaluating the operational performance of the investment decisions in different scenarios computed under the unit commitment model. Computational experiments in a case study of a large-scale Chilean power-hydrogen system show the effects of the proposed methodology on capacity expansion recommendations, where a correct balance between variable and flexible technologies is obtained. Moreover, when simulating the operation of the system for a full year, we observe that the proposed methodology generates an investment plan that achieves a lower total cost compared to other methodologies commonly used in the literature. Additional experiments in 100% renewable scenarios show how conventional methodologies reaches levels of not-supplied-energy between 2%-7%, while the proposed methodology achieves less than 1% in the same metric.

AB We have systematically studied the hydrogen adsorption mechanism, hydrogen dissociation, and diffusion on the high-index experimentally-found Mg(10 (1) over bar3) surface and made comparisons with the low-index Mg(0001) surface, using density-functional theory calculations. Various possible H adsorption sites and structures on the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3) are considered with H coverage up to eight monolayers. Specifically, the hydrogen adsorption sequence is found to be A(1)-fcc, A(2)-fcc, A(1)-tetra II, A(2)-tetra II, A(3)-fcc, B-1-hcp, B-2-hcp and B-1-octa. The H-Mg-H trilayer with Mg1.60+ and H-0.(80-) is found to be very stable during initial H uptake, while the H electron gain of 0.8 e (i.e., H-0(.8)0-) is shown to be a reliable indicator of H-adsorbed Mg(10 (1) over bar3) stability. Interestingly, on the one hand, H-2 dissociation is the role step during H uptake on Mg(10 (1) over bar3) with an H-2 dissociation energy barrier of 0.87 eV, which is consistent with the value on the low-index Mg(0001) from previous first principle calculations. On the other hand, the H diffusion barriers along the closed-packed planes are lower than those perpendicular to the planes, verifying that more feasible diffusion paths are available on the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3). These theoretical findings rationalize the previous joint experimental finding that the high-index Mg(10 (1) over bar3) dramatically decreases H sorption temperatures, and provide an H adsorption mechanism on high-index Mg surface very different from that on low-index Mg(0001), thus improving the foundation of Mg-based hydrogen storage material designs.

AB This study conducts a finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the sealing performance of type IV hydrogen storage vessels, focusing specifically on the viscoelastic properties of the liner material. The analysis aims to quantify the impact of key parameters, including sealing interface design, O-ring pre-compression, and liner thickness, on overall sealing integrity. Through detailed modeling of the interactions among the metal boss, polymer liner, and sealing ring, the study shows that ignoring the viscoelastic response of the polymer liner can result in a significant underestimation of radial deformation, by a factor of 0.4-0.5. Furthermore, the increasing thickness of the liner wall in the vessel mouth area intensifies deformation within the sealing zone, thereby increasing the potential for leakage. The presence of an annular groove at the interface between the metal seat and polymer liner is critical for effective sealing, generating contact stresses that meet the operational requirements at 52 MPa. Moreover, the O-ring's sealing effectiveness is highly sensitive to the initial compression rate, achieving optimal performance at rates above 16%. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing the reliability of component joints under high-pressure conditions, critical for ensuring the safety and operational efficiency of type IV hydrogen storage vessels.

AB The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound-responsive water-soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single-component sulfur-substituted 3-hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co-release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co-release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.
   Sulfur-substituted 3-hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single-component ultrasound-responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co-release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.image

AB The durability of membrane electrodes, which are the core components of the Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), seriously affects the service life of the stack. Under the action of long-term low temperature, the gas diffusion layer at the entrance will be aged and its micro-porous layer structure will be destroyed, which will hinder the removal of liquid water and gas transport, so it is necessary to preheat the anode hydrogen. In the present study, the influence of different pitch ratio and diameter ratio on heat transfer of corrugated tube heat exchanger is simulated by means of thermal-fluid coupled numerical simulation and periodic unit model, the effects of coolant flow rate and temperature on the overall heat transfer performance were also studied. The validity of the simulation results is verified by experiments, and the effect of hydrogen preheating on the stack performance is also tested. The simulation results show that the corrugated joint will disturb the flow of hydrogen, which increases the temperature gradient along the radial direction of the main flow and enhances the heat transfer. When Re is lower than 4000, the friction factor decreases quickly and then gradually flattens out. Compared with 0.5 for bellows with a pitch ratio of 1, the friction factor increases by 17%. With the increase of Re, the j values of different pitch ratios differ greatly and decrease linearly. For every 5 cm increase in the length of the corrugated tube, the total heat exchange capacity is increased by about 20% , and the total heat transfer increases about 100 W with the increase of the coolant flow 0.04 kg/s.

AB A single crystal Dy3Al2(AlO4)(3) rare-earth nanogarnets were grown via a sol-gel combustion method using single fuel. The structure and purity of nanogarnets was confirmed by XRD analysis. The average crystallite sizes and the effective particle sizes were calculated by Scherrer and Hall-Williamson equations. The FTIR results clearly confirmed the formation of metal-oxygen and metal-metal bonds of the product. The morphological studies were affirmed the nanoscale formation of Dy3Al5O12 with approximately narrow distribution of the particles. The direct band gap energy of the nanogarnets was calculated using Tauc equation about 3.33 eV. To complement the experimental data, the structural and electronic properties were calculated using periodic density functional theory. The use of the Hubbard U parameter was used and improved the band gap to experimental values. Experimental and computational observations have rendered the Dy3Al5O12 nanogarnets can be suitable for hydrogen energy sorption. The electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of Dy3Al5O12 was measured at about 3137 mAh/g after 15 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent inflammation and progressive joint destruction. Recent data underscore oxidative stress as a primary factor in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, intensifying inflammatory processes and tissue damage via the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and compromised antioxidant defenses. Current therapies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), primarily target immune dysregulation but fail to address oxidative stress, necessitating novel adjunctive treatment strategies. This review explores the potential of antioxidant-based therapies as complementary approaches to RA management. Natural compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and propolis exhibit strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties by modulating redox-sensitive pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO-1). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) replenishes intracellular glutathione, enhancing cellular resilience against oxidative stress. Additionally, molecular hydrogen (H2) selectively neutralizes harmful ROS, reducing oxidative damage and inflammation. The role of vitamin supplementation (D, B12, C, and K) in regulating immune responses and protecting joint structures is also discussed. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and potential clinical applications of antioxidant therapies in RA, emphasizing their role in mitigating oxidative damage and improving treatment outcomes. While preliminary findings are promising, further clinical trials are needed to establish standardized dosing, long-term safety, and their integration into current RA treatment protocols.

AB The paper presents an overview of advanced in situ diffraction studies as a highly valuable tool to probe the structure and reacting mechanisms of hydrogen and energy storage materials. These studies offer benefits from the use of a high flux diffraction beam in combination with high resolution measurements, and allow, even when using very small samples, establishing the mechanism of the phase-structural transformations and their kinetics based on a rapid data collection for the various charge-discharge states at variable test conditions. The applied conditions include a broad range of hydrogen/deuterium pressures, from vacuum to high pressures reaching 1000 bar H2/D2, and temperatures, from cryocooling (2 K) to as high as 1273 K (1000 degrees C). Simultaneously, various state-of-charge and discharge are probed when studying metal-H/D systems for hydrogen/deuterium gas storage and as anode electrodes of metal hydride batteries. The range of the studied systems includes but is not limited to the AB5, AB2 Laves type, AB, equiatomic ternary ABC intermetallics and Mg-containing layered AB3 structures and composites. Prospects on Li-ion full cells are considered as well. Interrelations between the structure and hydrogen storage performance, including maximum and reversible H storage capacity, hysteresis of hydrogen absorption and desorption, H2 absorption and desorption in dynamic equilibrium conditions, are considered and related to the ultimate goal of optimisation of the H storage behaviours of the advanced H storage materials. Numerous contributions of Dr. Michel Latroche to the field are highlighted, particularly in in situ studies during electrochemical transformations. The paper summarises a long-standing collaboration of the co-authors in the field, which also included 29 joint topical publications with Dr. Michel Latroche, and references 163 original publications.

   the Lamb shifts to the motion-induced shifts

   equation; the Lamb shift; atom-motion-induced shifts
ID FINE-STRUCTURE; HELIUM; EQUATION; SPACE
AB When the hydrogen atom moves, the proton current generates a magnetic field which interacts with the hydrogen electron. A simple analysis shows that for the hydrogen velocity nu/c <<alpha the dominant interaction between the hydrogen momentum and the electron is of order of alpha(3)nu/cm, where a is the fine structure constant, v is the atom velocity, c is the speed of light and m is the electron mass. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the two velocity-dependent operators of this order are derived. As is well known, the degeneracy of the energy levels with the same principal quantum number, n, and the same quantum number of the total angular momentum, j, but the different orbital angular momenta l = j +/- 1/2 is removed by the radiative corrections (the Lamb shift) that are proportional to alpha(5)m. It is shown that the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions remove this degeneracy as well. There is, however, an important difference between the Lamb shifts and the energy-level shifts induced by the atom motion. The Lamb shift is the diagonal correction to the energy separately for each of the degenerate states. The velocity-dependent perturbation interactions result in the off-diagonal energy corrections between the mutually degenerate states. The joint effect of these two perturbations, which are essentially different in their origin, is analyzed. Given their order of magnitude, the crossover from the Lamb shifts to the motion-induced shifts should occur at the atom velocity nu = k alpha(2)c, where k >> 1 is a numerical factor dependent on n and j. An experiment using the orbital motion of the Earth is proposed to test the developed theory.

   ORIGIN
AB Multiply charged superfluid helium nanodroplets are utilized to facilitate the growth of cationic copper clusters (Cun+, where n = 1-8) that are subsequently solvated with up to 50 H2 molecules. Production of both pristine and protonated cationic Cu clusters are detected mass spectrometrically. A joint effort between experiment and theory allows us to understand the nature of the interactions determining the bonding between pristine and protonated Cu+ and Cu2+ cations and molecular hydrogen. The analysis reveals that in all investigated cationic clusters, the primary solvation shell predominantly exhibits a covalent bonding character, which gradually decreases in strength, while for the subsequent shells an exclusive non-covalent behaviour is found. Interestingly, the calculated evaporation energies associated with the first solvation shell markedly surpass thermal values, positioning them within the desirable range for hydrogen storage applications. This comprehensive study not only provides insights into the solvation of pristine and protonated cationic Cu clusters but also sheds light on their unique bonding properties.
   We underscore a solid agreement between experimental and computational studies on solvation of pristine/protonated Cun+ (n = 1-2) in H2. For instance, with n = 1, the initial shell comprises four covalently bound H2; subsequent ones are non-covalent.

AB Glycosaminoglycans are a wide class of biopolymers showing great lubricating properties due to their structure and high affinity to water. Two of them, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, play an important role in articular cartilage lubrication. In this work, we present results of the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both molecules placed in water-based solution. To mimic changes of the physiological conditions, especially temperature, of the synovial fluid in joints under successive load (e.g., walking, jogging, jumping), simulations have been performed at different physiological temperatures in the range of 300 to 320 Kelvin (normal intra-articular temperature is 305 K). The stability of the biopolymeric network at equilibrium (isothermal and isobaric) conditions has been studied. To understand the process of physical crosslinking, the dynamics of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds forming and breaking have been studied. The results show that following addition of chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronan creates more intermolecular hydrogen bonds than when in homogeneous solution. The presence of chondroitin in a hyaluronan network is beneficial as it may increase its stability. Presented data show hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate as viscosity modifiers related to their crosslinking properties in different physicochemical conditions.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) integration into power supply systems. A hybrid energy complex (HEC) based on PEMFCs and lithium iron phosphate batteries can be used as a reliable energy source. It is necessary to properly determine the PEMFC characteristics in order to develop a PEMFC-based HEC prototype and its control algorithms. This paper presents a 1 kW PEMFC's test results in steady and dynamic modes. The dependences of the average hydrogen consumption per 1 min, the volume of hydrogen for the generation of 1 kWh, the PEMFC efficiency on the load current were obtained and an analysis of these dependences for steady operation modes was performed. A range of load changes beyond which the efficiency of the PEMFC significantly decreased and it was recommended to switch to the joint operation of the PEMFCs and batteries (or only batteries) was established. Diagrams of the PEMFC output voltage during the dynamic changes in loads are presented and an analysis of transient response characteristics was carried out. The air supply fans were found to affect the performance of PEMFCs.

AB This paper presents a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of sensor response of nanostructured In2O3 semiconductor thin films containing a large concentration of conduction electrons. The capture of the conduction electrons by oxygen adsorbates from air causes redistribution of the electrons inside the nanoparticles, resulting in reduction of the subsurface electron density, and the drop of the conductivity of nanoparticle thin films. When CO and H-2 reduced gas analytes are introduced to the system, their reaction with previously adsorbed negative atomic oxygen ions O- releases electrons back to the nanoparticles, producing a noticeable increase of thin-film conductivity, which constitutes the sensor effect. This work presents a kinetic model of such processes, which allows us to a quantitative description of the sensor effect including dependence of sensor sensitivity on temperature. Concurrently, experiments are performed to quantify the sensor response by nanostructured In2O3 thin film as a function of temperature and hydrogen concentration upon addition of hydrogen gas to the gas medium. The measured response is described well by the theoretical model developed in this work.

AB Histidine tautomerism plays a key role in the aggregation of amyloid peptides, which is important for understanding the origin of Alzheimer's disease as well as its diagnosis and treatment. Herein, density functional theory calculations were performed using explicit water molecules and joint implicit/explicit water cluster models to explore the catalytic mechanism and the key role of water assistance effect in the histidine tautomerization reaction. To clarify the proton transfer mechanism involved in histidine tautomerization, three to five water molecules were used to catalyze the proton transfer process governing the transition between the histidine tautomers. Potential energy calculations showed that hi epsilon.(H2O) n tautomerism proceeds via a single proton transfer pathway. Systematic analyses of the hydrogen bonds and charge distribution of the key components indicated that tautomerism can be promoted by reducing the number of assistant water molecules or involving the joint implicit/explicit water solvent effect. This study provides theoretical insights into the mechanism of water-assisted histidine isomerization as it relates to the A ss aggregation hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB This study aimed to evaluate Poly (caprolactone) microparticles (MPs) loaded composite injectable Chitosan gel (CICGs) as a dual purpose (visco-supplement and intra articular drug delivery depot) therapeutic agent for the treatment of Osteoarthritis. Etoricoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), a highly hydrophobic drug was chosen as a model drug for the study. When administered orally, Etoricoxib poses severe cardiovascular toxicity issues. So, we have attempted to deliver this drug intra-articularly, which could retain the drug longer in the joint region and thus could ameliorate these toxicity issues. CICGs were prepared by dispersing MPs in the chitosan-Ammonium hydrogen phosphate solution and incubated at 37 degrees C. Rheology studies proved that gels were stable and had visco-elastic properties comparable to that of existing visco-supplements. The in vitro drug release profiles of CICGs were found to be more controlled when compared to MPs and bare chitosan gel (BCGs). In vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies proved that the gels were biocompatible. In vivo synovial drug clearance studies proved that CICGs had a better drug retention capacity than BCGs and MPs. In vivo fluorescence imaging results confirmed that CICGs could stay longer in the joint region when compared to BCGs and MPs. Thus this novel CICGs could be a potential dual purpose gel for the treatment of diseased joint regions especially for Osteoarthritis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chitosan-collagen blends have been widely applied in tissue engineering, joints diseases treatment, and many other biomedical fields. Understanding the affinity between chitosan and collagen type II is particularly relevant in the context of mechanical properties modulation, which is closely associated with designing biomaterials suitable for cartilage and synovial fluid regeneration. However, many structural features influence chitosan's affinity for collagen. One of the most important ones is the deacetylation degree (DD) in chitosan and the hydroxylation degree (HD) of proline (PRO) moieties in collagen. In this paper, combinations of both factors were analyzed using a very efficient molecular dynamics approach. It was found that DD and HD modifications significantly affect the structural features of the complex related to considered types of interactions, namely hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and ionic contacts. In the case of hydrogen bonds both direct and indirect (water bridges) contacts were examined. In case of the most collagen analogues, a very good correlation between binding free energy and DD was observed.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is closely associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the microbiota-gut-joint axis. Current interventions often overlook the cascade nature of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in driving intestinal and systemic inflammation. Herein, a valence-engineered CeOX-based nanozyme with self-cascade catalytic activity is developed, mimicking sequential oxidase-superoxide dismutase-peroxidase functions to enable continuous ROS scavenging while minimizing oxygen generation. By precisely tuning Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios from 0.27 to 0.93 through Au deposition (0.23 wt.%-> 5.2 wt.%), Dual functionality is achieved: 1) enhanced oxygen vacancy generation (71.4%) for efficient ROS scavenging via superoxide anion -> hydrogen peroxide -> hydroxide ion conversion, and 2) suppressed oxygen production to maintain the anaerobic microenvironment essential for gut microbiota. Encapsulating the nanozyme with sodium alginate (SA) to form Au/CeOX(0.93)@SA ensures resistance to gastric acid upon oral administration. In RA model rats, this strategy restored gut microbial balance, normalized short-chain fatty acid profiles, and significantly attenuated joint inflammation and cartilage degradation. The therapeutic efficacy is further evidenced by reduced systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improved intestinal barrier integrity. This study established a design paradigm for gut microenvironment-adapted nanozymes, offering a dual-action strategy for early RA intervention through synchronized ROS elimination and microbiota homeostasis restoration.

AB We present a new method to infer parameters of the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization epoch at z similar to 2-4. This method is based on the analysis of the distribution of Ly alpha absorbers over column densities and Doppler parameters by the model joint probability density function. This approach allows us to measure the power-law index gamma of the temperature-density relation and a certain combination of the temperature at the mean density T-0 and hydrogen photoionization rate Gamma. To estimate T-0 and Gamma separately, we employ measurements of the Ly alpha forest effective opacity and the model gas probability density function. We show that gamma tends to be lower than 1.6 and reaches 1.3 at redshift similar to 3. The inferred temperatures at the mean density are similar to(2 +/- 0.5) x 10(4) K in the studied redshift range. Both these estimates favor He II reionization at z greater than or similar to 3. We find that the hydrogen photoionization rate is similar to 0.6 x 10(-12) s(-1), which is consistent with previous measurements.

SO MATERIALS HORIZONS

DT Article; Early Access
AB Flexible and self-healing ion-conductive materials show potential advantages in wearable health monitoring systems based on the internet of things (IoT). However, their practical applications are limited by the directional selectivity and detection range of the sensor. Here, a room-temperature self-healing, ion-conductive polyurethane elastomer that shows excellent mechanical properties, high conductivity, bidirectional sensing and thermoelectric properties was synthesized. Due to the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds, it can effectively dissipate energy through the destruction and recombination of multiple reversible hydrogen bonds, achieving a high mechanical strength (34 MPa) and excellent room-temperature self-healing ability (self-healing efficiency of 91.4%). Significantly, the synergistic monitoring of strain, temperature, and thermoelectricity can be realized based on the existence of the synergistic ion/electron-conductive components of the self-healing ion-conductive elastomer. The strain module enables bi-directional monitoring and high sensitivity (GF similar to 5.23). Additionally, the temperature module has a resistance temperature coefficient of 2.42, while the thermoelectric module provides a power density of 1.59 mW m-1 K-2. Furthermore, leveraging the photon-thermal-electric coupling effect, a non-contact photoelectric sensor is fabricated, which can realize high-temperature detection/protection. As a wearable electronic device, it shows advantages in joint rehabilitation monitoring systems and prevention/monitoring systems.

AB The quality of electron beam welding between GH4169 and electroformed Ni (E-Ni) has emerged as a pivotal factor in the manufacturing of hydrogen-oxygen engines. The welding process involving dissimilar materials, however, is susceptible to the occurrence of incomplete fusion defects, with the underlying causes of these defects remaining elusive. In order to enhance the welding quality of GH4169 and E-Ni and eliminate incomplete fusion defects, a novel finite element model integrating thermo-electro-magnetic multi-physical fields coupling was established in this study, revealing the formation mechanism of such defects. The results demonstrated that significant thermoelectric effects arose during the welding process due to the disparities in temperature gradients and Seebeck coefficients between GH4169 and E-Ni. The thermoelectric effect induces the emergence of a magnetic field, primarily concentrated within a 10 mm zone above the weld. Subsequently, this magnetic field causes a significant deflection of the electron beam towards the GH4169, specifically by 128 mu m. This deviation ultimately results in the occurrence of incomplete fusion defects, compromising the welding quality. Based on the underlying mechanism of the thermoelectric effect on the electron beam, an inclined welding joint was designed, successfully eliminating the incomplete fusion defects at the root of the GH4169 and E-Ni electron beam welding joint. The resulting joint exhibited a remarkable strength of 411 MPa. The present analysis of the incomplete fusion defect formation mechanism provides theoretical support for the improvement of the electron beam welding process for GH4169 and E-Ni, pioneering a novel defect-free welding technique for these materials.

AB As renewable energy technologies advance, identifying efficient photocatalytic materials for water splitting to produce hydrogen has become an important research focus in materials science. This study presents a multi-task regression model (MTRM) designed to predict the conduction band minimum (CBM), valence band maximum (VBM), and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) of inorganic materials. Utilizing crystallographic and band gap data from over 15,000 materials in the SNUMAT database, machine-learning methods are applied to predict CBM and VBM, which are subsequently used as additional features to estimate STH. A deep neural network framework with a multi-branch, multi-task regression structure is employed to address the issue of error propagation in traditional cascading models by enabling feature sharing and joint optimization of the tasks. The calculated results show that, while traditional tree-based models perform well in single-task predictions, MTRM achieves superior performance in the multi-task setting, particularly for STH prediction, with an MSE of 0.0001 and an R2 of 0.8265, significantly outperforming cascading approaches. This research provides a new approach to predicting photocatalytic material performance and demonstrates the potential of multi-task learning in materials science.

AB High-precision time synchronization is significant to fundamental physics and measurement science. And stable timescales are the basis for high-precision time synchronization. Timescales are mainly established based on atomic clocks. Despite the good short-term stability of atomic clocks, their long-term stability is compromised by frequency drift and noises. This seriously reduces the accuracy of time synchronization. In contrast, millisecond pulsars exhibit excellent long-term stability. Combining atomic clocks with pulsars in timekeeping helps to improve stability performance which is of great significance for improving time synchronization accuracy. Therefore, the millisecond pulsar augmented atomic clock ensemble timescale algorithm is proposed. Firstly, frequency drifts of hydrogen masers are eliminated with reference of the pulsar and the long-term stability of atomic clocks is improved. Then, the weighted average algorithm with special weight design is proposed to establish the joint ensemble timescale. Experiment results show that the joint ensemble timescale improved the Allan deviation of 2.83 x 10-13 and 8.82 x 10-13 on one-year and three-year averaging time compared with atomic time. For short-term stability, the joint ensemble timescale improved the Allan deviation of 1.47 x 10-13 and 2.01 x 10-13 on one-day and one-month averaging time compared with pulsar time. The proposed algorithm is expected to establish stable time to achieve high-precision time synchronization in measurement science.

The catalyst of the composition 0.4Co/HZSM-5/SO42- (2.0)-ZrO2 at 180 degrees C allows up to 63.5% of gaseous C4- alkanes to be involved in isomerization-disproportionation processing of the mixture of straight-run naphtha and propane-butane fraction (1 : 1 by weight), the content of C-5-C-6 alkanes in the catalyzate to be increased by 21.4%, and the relative content of their branched isomers to be increased to 88.8%. The effect of hydrogen on the conversion of C4- and C8+ components of the mixture of straight-run naphtha and propane-butane fraction (1 : 1 by weight) was studied; an increase in the H-2/hydrocarbon ratio from 2 to 4 leads to an increase in the conversion of C4- alkanes from 63.5 to 90%. The possibility of expanding the resources for producing C-5-C-6 alkanes with increased content of high-octane branched components by joint processing of the propane-butane fraction and straight-run naphtha was demonstrated.

AB Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is of paramount importance in addressing the inherent instability of clean energy generation and in facilitating the accelerated restructuring of the global energy mix. However, this technology entails greater requirements for the safety and stability of concrete lining. The present study comprises a series of shear tests on steel fiber reinforced shotcrete-rock (SFCR) specimens, which are subjected to a range of normal stress (6n), shear rate (SR), joint roughness coefficients (JRC) and steel fiber content (SF). The destabilization mechanism of the SFC-R interface is investigated through the integration of acoustic emission (AE), digital image correlation (DIC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Furthermore, the stress distribution characteristics of steel fibers are investigated through numerical simulation. Results show that a sudden drop in shear force occurs in the specimens after reaches the peak value, and due to the bridging effect of the steel fibers, some specimens show a rebound rise in shear force. During the shearing process, normal shear shrinkage is observed initially due to the closure of the cavity and compression of the material. Subsequently, normal shear expansion occurs due to the inhomogeneity of the joint surface. The mean level of AE hits and peak AE hits are proportional to 6n, SR and JRC. Besides, they showed a positive correlation with SF only during the intensified damage stage. As 6n, SR, and JRC increased, or SF decreased, the specimens demonstrated an inclination towards cracking, which ultimately resulted in the deterioration of the concrete and rock. Consequently, the stress level within the steel fibers embedded within the concrete is also increased. This is evidenced by the formation of aggregated regions exhibiting patchy deformation, as illustrated by the DIC images.

AB Plasma disruptions present a significant challenge to the viability of fusion energy production in tokamak reactors. Among disruption mitigation techniques, shattered pellet injection (SPI) has emerged as a promising approach. The results presented in this paper show novel findings of the impact of nitrogen and neon seeding on the disruption mitigation sequence following SPI on the Joint European Torus (JET). This study exposes an order of magnitude reduction in pre-thermal quench duration for highly seeded plasmas and pure deuterium SPI, a result with significant implications for staggered SPI schemes currently under development. Conversely, no reduction in disruption thermal load mitigation efficacy was observed for single neon and hydrogen mixed SPI across a range of seeding levels, indicating the robustness of this approach. A novel pathway for thermal load mitigation and enhanced runaway electron avoidance with pure deuterium SPI into strongly seeded plasmas is also presented.

AB Dissimilar metal welded (DMW) joint plays a crucial role in constructing and maintaining ultra-supercritical (USC) nuclear power plants while presenting noteworthy environmental implications. This research examines different welding techniques utilized in DMWJ, specifically emphasizing materials such as P91. The study investigates the mechanical properties of these materials, the impact of alloying elements, the notable difficulties encountered with industrial materials, and the concept of buttering. The USC nuclear power plants necessitate welding procedures appropriate for the fusion of diverse metal alloys. Frequently employed methodologies encompass shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), and flux-cored arc welding (FCAW). Every individual process possesses distinct advantages and limitations, and the choice of process is contingent upon various factors, including joint configuration, material properties, and the desired weld quality. The steel alloy known as P91, which possesses high strength and resistance to creep, is extensively employed in advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) power plants. P91 demonstrates exceptional mechanical characteristics, encompassing elevated-temperature strength, commendable thermal conductivity, and notable resistance against corrosion and oxidation. The presence of alloying elements, namely chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium, in P91, is responsible for its improved characteristics and appropriateness for utilization in (AUSC) power plant applications. Nevertheless, the utilization of industrial materials in DMW joint is accompanied by many noteworthy concerns, such as the propensity for stress corrosion cracking (SCC), hydrogen embrittlement, and creep deformation under high temperatures. The challenges mentioned above require meticulous material selection, process optimization, and rigorous quality control measures to guarantee the dependability and sustained effectiveness of DMW joint. To tackle these concerns, a commonly utilized approach referred to as buttering is frequently employed. When forming DMW joint in nuclear facilities, it is customary to place a buttering coating on ferritic steel. This facilitates the connection between pressure vessel components of ferritic steel and pipes of austenitic stainless steel. The primary difficulty in DMW joint manufacturing is in mitigating the significant disparity in material characteristics resulting from carbon migration and metallurgical alterations along the fusion interface between ferritic steel and austenitic stainless steel. The process of buttering entails the application of a compatible filler material onto the base metal before the deposition of the desired weld metal. The intermediate layer serves as a mediator, enhancing the metallurgical compatibility, diminishing the probability of fracture, and enhancing the overall integrity of the joint. Buttering is still a new research area with a wide scenario of scope in terms of development, which could revolutionize developing high-temperature. These long-term sustainable joints could serve under critical conditions like AUSC power plants and reduce CO2 emissions by increasing the overall efficiencies of the systems.

TI Hydrogen-assisted cracking in GMA welding of high-strength structural
   steels using the modified spray arc process
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD

AB High-strength structural steels are used in machine, steel, and crane construction with yield strength up to 960 MPa. However, welding of these steels requires profound knowledge of three factors in terms of avoidance of hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC): the interaction of microstructure, local stress/strain, and local hydrogen concentration. In addition to the three main factors, the used arc process is also important for the performance of the welded joint. In the past, the conventional transitional arc process (Conv. A) was mainly used for welding of high-strength steel grades. In the past decade, the so-called modified spray arc process (Mod. SA) has been increasingly used for welding production. This modified process enables reduced seam opening angles with increased deposition rates compared with the Conv. A. Economic benefits of using this arc type are a reduction of necessary weld beads and required filler material. In the present study, the susceptibility to HAC in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the high-strength structural steel S960QL was investigated with the externally loaded implant test. For that purpose, both Conv. A and Mod. SA were used with same heat input at different deposition rates. Both conducted test series showed same embrittlement index "EI" of 0.21 at diffusible hydrogen concentrations of 1.3 to 1.6 ml/100 g of arc weld metal. The fracture occurred in the HAZ or in the weld metal (WM). However, the test series with Mod. SA showed a significant extension of the time to failure of several hours compared with tests carried out with Conv. A.

AB The heating power to access the high confinement mode (H-mode), P (LH), scales approximately inversely with the isotope mass of the main ion plasma species as found in (protonic) hydrogen, deuterium and tritium plasmas in many fusion facilities over the last decades. In first dedicated L-H transition experiments at the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak facility with the ITER-like wall (ILW), the power threshold, P (LH), was studied systematically in plasmas of pure tritium and hydrogen-tritium mixtures at a magnetic field of 1.8 T and a plasma current of 1.7 MA in order to assess whether this scaling still holds in a metallic wall device. The measured power thresholds, P (LH), in Ohmically heated tritium plasmas agree well with the expected isotope scaling for metallic walls and the lowest power threshold was found in Ohmic phases at low density. The measured power thresholds in ion cyclotron heated plasmas of pure tritium or hydrogen-tritium mixtures are significantly higher than the expected isotope mass scaling due to higher radiation levels. However, when the radiated power is taken into account, the ion cyclotron heated plasmas exhibit similar power thresholds as a neutral beam heated plasma, and are close to the scaling. The tritium plasmas in this study tended to higher electron heating fractions and, when heated with ion cyclotron waves, to relatively higher radiation fractions compared to other isotopes potentially impeding access to sustained H-modes.

AB This work studied the Mn dopant layer gallium nitride (GaN) and addressed the suitability of Mn-doping as a means to potentially produce a semiconductor material system in GN derivatives. A comprehensive investigation on hydrogen grabbing by heteroclusters of Mn-doped GaN, AlGaN, InGaN was carried out using DFT computations at the CAM-B3LYP-D3/6-311+G(d, p) level of theory. The notable fragile signal intensity close to the parallel edge of the nanocluster sample might be owing to manganese binding induced non-spherical distribution of Mn@GaN, Mn@AlGaN or Mn@InGaN heteroclusters. The hypothesis of the energy adsorption phenomenon was confirmed by density distributions of CDD, TDOS/PDOS/OPDOS, and ELF for GaN and its alloys. A vaster jointed area engaged by an isosurface map for Mn doping GaN, AlGaN, InGaN towards formation of nanocomposites of Mn@GaN-H, Mn@AlGaN-H, Mn@InGaN-H after hydrogen adsorption due to labeling atoms of N4, Mn5, H18, respectively. Therefore, it can be considered that manganese in the functionalized Mn@GaN, Mn@AlGaN or Mn@InGaN might have more impressive sensitivity for accepting the electrons in the process of hydrogen adsorption. The changes of Gibbs free energy versus for all nanocomposites could detect the maximum efficiency of Mn@AlGaN-H > Mn@GaN-H > Mn@InGaN-H for energy storage through . The advantages of manganese over GaN, AlGaN, or InGaN include its higher electron and hole mobility, allowing manganese doping devices to operate at higher frequencies than non-doping devices.

AB Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is known as the heart of various energy storage and conversation systems of renewable energy sources. Here we observe the cluster reactions of a light transition metal, vanadium, with water in a gas-phase flow tube reactor. While HER products of V-1 and V-2 were not observed, the effective HER of water on neutral V-n (n >= 3) clusters reveals reasonable and size-dependent reactivity of the vanadium clusters. Superatomic features and reaction dynamics of V-10, V-13, and V-16 are highlighted. Among the three typical superatoms, V-10 and V-16 exhibit an abnormal superatomic orbital energy level order, 1S vertical bar 2S vertical bar 1P vertical bar 1D..., where the energy-reduced 2S orbital helps to accommodate the geometric structure and hence reinforce the cluster stability. In comparison, V-13 bears a less symmetrical structure and reacts readily with water, allowing for recombination of a hydroxyl atom with an adsorbed hydrogen atom, akin to a fishing-mode HER process. The joint experimental and theoretical study on neutral Vn clusters clarifies the availability of superatom chemistry for transition metals and appeals further development of cluster theory based on electronic cloud/orbital analysis instead of simply counting the valence electrons. Also, we provide insights into the HER mechanism of metal clusters and propose a strategy to design new materials for portable fuel cells of hydrogen energy.

AB The automotive business is growing continuously along with the global economy. One way to lessen environmental pollution in recent times is to look for clean energy to replace traditional fossil fuels as the vehicle's power source. This is because there is a lack of environmental energy among other issues. This manuscript proposes an Energy Management Strategy of Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles. The proposed hybrid technique is the joint execution of both the Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO) and Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRNN). Hence, it is named as GTO-HGRNN technique. This proposed method's principal objective is to reduce hydrogen use and raise battery longevity. The proposed GTO approach is used to optimize the DC/DC converter parameter and fuel consumption and the HGRNN approach is used to predict the optimal parameter of the DC/DC converter parameter. By then, the MATLAB platform has the proposed method been implemented, and the existing method is used to compute the execution. Better outcomes are shown by the proposed strategy in all existing systems like Genetic Algorithm, Global Optimisation Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The existing method shows hydrogen consumption of 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.2% the proposed method shows a hydrogen consumption of 0.1% which is lower than another existing system. The existing method shows the cost of 14.90$, 15.90$, and 16.90$ the proposed method shows the cost of 13.90$, which is lower than another existing system.

AB Exploring efficient and robust photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation from water reduction is great significant in solving the energy shortage and environment contamination simultaneously. Herein, benefiting from the matchable energy band structures and band bending, the direct Z-scheme ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 heterojunctions were successfully constructed by anchoring p-type NiWO4 nanoparticles onto n-type ZnIn2S4 nanosheets through a facile sonochemical route. By carefully regulating the interfacial structure, the optimized ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 heterostructure without any cocatalyst displays excellent stability and remarkably improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (16.3 mmol & BULL;g � 1 & BULL;h-1), more 3.57-folds increment than bare ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. Mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance mainly results from the constructed Z-scheme heterostructure and intimately interfacial contact between ZnIn2S4 and NiWO4, which results in the valid interfacial charge transfer channels, powerful redox potential and reduced hydrogen evolution energy barrier, as confirmed by the joint analysis of electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoelectrochemical measurements. More importantly, the photoinduced holes of ZnIn2S4 are rapidly and effectively consumed in the unique Z-scheme charge transfer channels, which greatly favors the suppression of the photocorrosion caused by insufficient hole extraction during the photocatalytic reaction, thereby promoting the overall stability and reusability of the ZnIn2S4/NiWO4 composite photocatalyst. This study paves the way for constructing other Z-scheme nano-heterostructure consisting of p-type and n-type semiconductors with efficient photoactivity and robust stability for energy and environmental applications.

AB Objective The objective of this article is the creation and investigation of bifunctional suppositories that are endowed with antifungal and probiotic properties intended for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and colonization of the vaginal cavity by powerful lactobacilli. Materials and methods Freeze-dried Lactobacillus delbrueckii MH10 was used as a probiotic, which is an active producer of H2O2 isolated from a healthy woman's vagina. Hydrophilic PEG 4000/400, amphiphilic Suppocire AP, and lipophilic Novata ABPH bases were used for the preparation of vaginal suppositories and each included 80 mg terconazole and 25 mg (similar to 10(9) CFU) lactobacilli. The release kinetic of active agents from suppositories was studied using the British Pharmacopeia's basket dissolution method, and the physicochemical properties were studied using known methods. Bioadhesion of suppositories was evaluated by flow rate from polyacrylamide substrate inclined at 60 degrees. Antagonism of lactobacillus against fungi was studied using the disk diffusion method and joint cultivation in simulated vaginal fluid. Results The release rate of active ingredients from the suppositories was PEG 4000/400 > Suppocire AP > Novata ABPH in decreasing order. Suppositories made of Suppocire AP possessed higher adhesion ability to artificial mucosa and longer shelf life. It was revealed that during joint cultivation L. delbrueckii MH10 kills more than 90% of C. albicans population. Conclusions Due to its physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, and bioadhesive properties, the base Suppocire AP is preferable for manufacturing vaginal bifunctional suppositories. Lactobacilli kill C. albicans by coaggregating and direct releasing hydrogen peroxide onto target cells.

AB The observations of solar flare onsets show rapid increase of hard and soft X-rays, ultra-violet emission with large Doppler blue shifts associated with plasma upflows, and Ha hydrogen emission with red shifts up to 1-4 angstrom. Modern radiative hydrodynamic models account well for blue-shifted emission, but struggle to reproduce closely the red-shifted Ha lines. Here we present a joint hydrodynamic and radiative model showing that during the first seconds of beam injection the effects caused by beam electrons can reproduce Ha line profiles with large red-shifts closely matching those observed in a C1.5 flare by the Swedish Solar Telescope. The model also accounts closely for timing and magnitude of upward motion to the corona observed 29 s after the event onset in 171 angstrom by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly/Solar Dynamics Observatory.

AB The paper presents the results of an investigation of the nanostructure, elements, and phase composition of thin (100-140 nm) tin dioxide films obtained via magnetron sputtering and containing Ag, Y, Sc, Ag + Y, and Ag + Sc additives in the volume. Electrical and gas-sensitive characteristics of hydrogen sensors based on these films with dispersed Pt/Pd layers deposited on the surface were studied. The additives had a significant effect on the nanostructure of the films, the density of oxygen adsorption sites on the surface of tin dioxide, the band bending at the grain boundaries of tin dioxide, the resistance values in pure air, and the responses to hydrogen in the concentration range of 50-2000 ppm. During the long-term tests of most of the samples studied, there was an increase in the resistance of the sensors in clean air and in the response to hydrogen. It has been established that the joint introduction of Ag + Y into the volume of films prevents the increase in the resistance and response. For these sensors based on thin films of Pt/Pd/SnO2:Sb, Ag, Y the responses to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 are 25 and 575, correspondingly, the response time at exposure to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 are 10 and 90 s, the recovery time at exposure to 100 and 1000 ppm of H-2 17 and 125 s. Possible mechanisms of the effect of additives on the properties of sensors and the stability of their parameters during long-term operation were considered.

AB To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, integrated energy hubs (EHs) based on coupled energy sources such as electricity, gas and heat are gaining increasing attention due to their efficient and flexible energy supply characteristics. The introduction of integrated EHs may lead to the reconstruction of the existing superior energy network to accommodate the suitable flow of the new network. In this study, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed that synergistically considers the optimal configuration of EHs and the reconstruction of higher-level energy networks, with the objectives of minimizing total annual energy supply costs and CO 2 emissions. First, an EH and multi-energy network (MEN) topology model considering hydrogen energy is developed. Secondly, the joint output of wind and solar power under typical scenarios is sampled and obtained by employing the Monte Carlo sampling method and the synchronous back-propagation scenario analysis method. To address the nonlinear constraint problem associated with multi-energy storage output, the Big -M method is introduced to improve the optimization capability of spatial -temporal coupling of energy storage. Moreover, the utilization potential of hydrogen and renewable energy is explored by considering constraints on the nonlinear dynamic pricing of hydrogen. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted using an illustrative example. The Pareto frontier optimal results, derived from fuzzy theory membership functions, are achieved using both classical and heuristic algorithms. The classical mixed-integer linear programming algorithm yields relatively superior optimization outcomes in terms of annual energy costs and carbon emissions compared to the heuristic algorithm. However, it suffers from longer computation times.

AB The fundamental understanding and precise tuning of interatomic s,p-d orbital hybridization are critical to the design of interstitial alloy catalysts containing light constituent atoms. Here, we present a joint theoretical and experimental study that reveals the importance of distribution, concentration and ordering of interstitial boron atoms in Pd-B alloy's near-surface electronic structure and catalytic performance. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sub-surface location of interstitial boron atoms with a Pd:B atomic ratio of 2:1 is necessary to ensure an appropriate degree of interatomic s,p-d orbital hybridization, and thereby an optimal surface electronic structure for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We experimentally achieve this with highlycrystalline intermetallic Pd2B. Due to its optimal electronic structure and ordered arrangement of interstitial boron atoms, the intermetallic Pd2B exhibits Pt-like catalytic activity for HER and has excellent catalytic stability for over seven days.

AB As a result of the development of energy commercialization, integrated energy services can meet multiple forms of energy supply. In this paper, the cooperative game of a multi-park integrated energy system for industrial, commercial, and residential areas with hydrogen energy based on Nash bargaining theory is established towards the joint dispatching of parks with operation differences in energy sharing mode. Firstly, the techno-economic framework considering the difference of park integrated energy systems is built, whilst introducing the hydrogen-doped electric-to-gas process. Second, by taking into consideration the interests demands and individual differences of each park subject through the cooperative game, the operation representing the interests of the multi-park integrated energy system is established. Then, on the basis of ensuring that the proposed cooperative game model can maximize the social benefits, the original problem is transformed into two easier-to-solve sub-problems. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to successively solve the two sub-problems in a distributed manner. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed model can reduce the purchased cost by 1298.8199 $, operation cost by 2319.3456 $, and carbon emissions by 62.1281 t, and improve the renewable energy integration by 12.3011 MW compared with the non-cooperative operation.

AB The Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Fuel Cell (FC) in Daily Market is one of the main Problems of these resources. Uncertain nature of market price and power system parameters can be affected to economic performance of DERs and is caused deviation penalties during market settlements. This article introduces an optimal combined sharing strategy of fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response as microgrid to improve all of them profit in market participation. In order to adjust of contracted power and reduce the imbalanced energy, the Adjusted Market (AM) is considered 3-7 h before the delivered time, which the offered power could be updated in this time. Uncertainty of markets and DERs generations is considered using an optimal stochastic optimization approach. The probabilistic scenarios are generated using forecast error database in daily, adjusted and imbalance market as production of DERs. Uncertain variables are predicted by a neuro-fuzzy model. Finally, to demonstrate of the proposed joint model strategy, a test system contain fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response is considered and the results is calculated during one week, month, and year period in joint and separated conditions.

AB The regions of CANDU (R) pressure tubes near the rolled joint (RJ) are the un-supported portions of the inlet and outlet ends just inboard of where the tubes make contact with the 403 stainless steel end fitting sections. Compared to the main body of the pressure tube, in-service conditions are more complex with large gradients in the flux, significant hydrogen isotope concentration profiles and varying operating temperatures. In order to increase the amount of data related to microstructure evolution, the microstructures near rolled-joint regions from an ex-service CANDU pressure tube were investigated. The results show that irradiation-induced effects on the microstructure are more significant than the temperature influence near the inlet rolled-joint region (that operates at lower temperatures). Thermal effects play a more dominant role than the flux near the outlet region (that operates at higher temperatures). Zirconium hydrides aligned in both circumferential and radial directions of the tube have been observed. The zirconium hydrides have an orientation relationship of (0002)(alpha Zr)//((111) over bar)(ZrH), and [2 (11) over bar0](alpha Zr)//[011](ZrH) with the alpha-Zr matrix; the hydride phases were identified as gamma (gamma) hydride by observing superlattice reflections on the (110) planes in the electron diffraction patterns. The presence of g hydrides at room temperature in the studied tube may have technical importance because in most of the previous research, delta hydrides were considered as the stable phase that would precipitate during cooling at reactor relevant rates. This assumption has been applied to both delayed hydride cracking (DHC) and fracture toughness experiments and during development of related models. It is critical to elucidate the phases of zirconium hydrides at relevant in-service conditions to enable representative experimental testing and modelling that can be used to verify and/or improve the predictive capability of material evolution and cracking behavior of zirconium alloys in nuclear reactors.

AB Offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects enjoy increasingly significant attention due to environmental protection advantages. Nevertheless, the development is hampered by multiple factors and therefore lagging expectations. Some studies have been devoted to this but there still are two deficiencies, namely incomplete barrier identification and biased analysis methods. Hence, this study is devoted to build a comprehensive research framework to effectively address barriers and promote high-quality development of offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects. Firstly, possible barriers are screened covering all stages of project management life cycle, and fourteen barriers are identified. Then a modified fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory method is applied to analyze these barriers, where K-Mediods clustering algorithm is introduced to improve threshold determination. Interactions among barriers are divided into four degrees with key parameters analyzed under four scenarios, and furtherly five critical barriers are extracted. By comparative analysis, the improved method promotes objectiveness of the result and thus is reliable to be applied to relevant analysis work. In conclusion, it is suggested to place emphasis on complicated planning & design, lack of technical specifications, high initial investment, immature business model and lack of high-matching modeling technology, joint efforts by government department, multiple enterprises and scientific institutions with five corresponding management suggestions.

AB Due to low ignition energy and wide range of flammability limit, explosion hazard of hydrogen/ammonia fuel must be evaluated to ensure safety application. In this work, effects of equivalence ratio, ammonia addition and initial pressure on the flame morphology and explosion pressure are revealed. The results demonstrate that effects of three factors on explosion hazard are ranked from the most important to the least important as initial pressure, equivalence ratio and ammonia hydrogen. The cellular flame formation by varying the equivalence ratio could be mainly attributed to the diffusional-thermal instability. The expanding flame of Phi = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 tends to be stable with ammonia addition. As initial pressure increases, there exists a joint and competitive effect of the diffusionai-thermal instability and hydrodynamic instability. Maximum explosion pressure of Phi = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 decreases monotonously with ammonia addition and increases linearly with initial pressure. The explosion pressure prediction is underestimated using the smooth flame model and reproduced satisfactorily using the wrinkled flame model. By varying equivalence ratio, ammonia addition and initial pressure, the most elementary reaction that enhances laminar flame velocity is R9 and the first two inhibiting reactions to laminar burning velocity are R10 and R168.

AB In harsh offshore environments, large-area sintered nano-copper (Cu) interconnections, which serve as die attachment material or thermal interface material (TIM), are prone to degradation from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) corrosion. This study introduced a film-forming technique based on atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to improve the corrosion resistance of large-area sintered nanoCu joint. The corrosion protection mechanism against H2S-containing atmospheric corrosion was investigated using both experimental methods and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The key findings were as follows: (1) The deposition film, primarily composed of a Si-O3 network, effectively protected sintered Cu plate from corrosion by H2S gas, and maintaining the mechanical performance of sintered Cu joint after 384 h of H2S testing. (2) The dissociation products of the APPJ-treated precursor hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO),-OSiCH3 and-OSi(CH3)3, formed stable chemical bonds on the sintered nanoCu surface, resulting in the formation of-OSiCH3(O-CH3)2 fragments. (3) The-OSiCH3(O-CH3)2 fragments were unreactive toward to corrosion agents such as H2S, O2, and H2O, and also serving as a barrier to block their access to the sintered nanoCu surface. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of the corrosion protection mechanism of sintered nanoCu using APPJ-deposited films, offering valuable insights for improving the reliability of power electronics.

AB Bottom on the ripple of the multiplication of sharing economy, hydrogen energy storage (HES) shared calls for novel solutions to ameliorate the cleanness and economy of micro-grids under the dual carbon target in China. The traditional investment method may become impracticable due to conflicting interests, insufficient utilization, and poor interoperability. The practical and prospective design of HES relies on innovation at the joint investment mechanism under incomplete synchronized and the interested equilibrium under limited rationality. This paper studies the capacity planning method for HES by multiple micro-grids from the sharing perspective. The evolution game model is utilized for conflict of interest, which exactly accounts for limited rationality. The dynamic competitive as well as time-varying demand for HES among multiple micro-grids are established by a small-word complex network theory. The dual dynamic evolutionary game of investment decision in multimicro-grid and capacity planning for sharing HES is realized by a proposed method of differential evolutionary game algorithm based on experience-weighted attraction learning. The numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and interpret the development path for sharing HES. The result shows that, the sizing method with limited rationality reduces the cost by 4.75% compared with the traditional game under complete rationality and 9.15% compared with the multi-objective optimization. The willingness of the park to participate in joint investment in shared HES is influenced by the long-term regulatory demand for energy storage and the decisions of other parks in the neighbors.

AB In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based energy optimization management method for hydrogenelectric coupling system is proposed for the conversion and utilization and joint optimization operation of hydrogen, wind and solar energy forms considering information uncertainty on the demand side of smart grid. Based on the wind energy, photovoltaic energy generation and load forecast information, the method uses deep Q network to simulate the energy management strategy set of the hydrogen-electric coupling system, and obtains the optimal strategy through reinforcement learning to finally realize the optimal operation of the hydrogenelectric coupling system based on the demand response. Firstly, based on the energy management model, a research framework and equipment model for integrated energy systems is established. On the basis of fundamental theories of reinforcement learning framework, Q-learning algorithm and DQN algorithm, the empirical replay mechanism and freezing parameter mechanism to improve the performance of DQN are analyzed, and the energy management and optimization of integrated energy system is completed with the objective of economy. By comparing the performance of DQN algorithms with different parameters in integrated energy system energy management, the simulation results demonstrate the improvement of algorithm performance after inheriting the set of strategies, and verify the feasibility and superiority of deep reinforcement learning compared to genetic algorithm in integrated energy system energy management applications.

AB A precise X-ray crystal structure determination of systems that exist in a polycrystalline form often poses a challenge due to several factors that limit the resolution of the diffraction measurement. The location of atoms is usually determined at significantly lower precision than the unit cell parameters, rendering the complete characterization of the structure difficult. This is particularly pronounced when precise location of hydrogen atoms is required, for instance in ionizable biomolecules or in hydrogen bonds. In such cases periodic quantum (DFT) calculations may crucially assist structure determination, because they can reliably predict the location of atoms, provided that the unit cell parameters, the space group and tentative atomic positions are known. In this work we present DFT-assisted structure determination of pentadecafluorooctanoic acid hydrate, a benchmark system featuring short hydrogen bonds (Ro...o approximate to 2.5 angstrom) between acid and water molecules. While Rietveld refinement based solely on powder diffraction data cannot reliably resolve the location of crystal water molecules and even less so the position of hydrogen atoms in the network of hydrogen bonds, periodic DFT optimization yields several minimum energy structures suitable for further refinement. Due to the low experimental resolution and similarity, comparison between model and experimental powder diffraction pattern can barely distinguish between certain structure candidates provided by DFT calculations, but it can rule out those featuring larger misfits. The proposed structure solution is delivered from a tandem application of structure determination from powder diffraction data and DFT optimization, the former providing the unit cell parameters and estimated atomic positions that are finely tuned by DFT. The present strategy can in principle be generalized to other examples of structure determination at relatively low resolution, such as is often the case with biological macromolecules.

AB In industries such as oil and gas, power generation, and manufacturing, the joining of dissimilar material is a common practice to optimize structural integrity, corrosion resistance, and other key properties. Dissimilar joint made of pipeline material and duplex stainless steel is prone to failure due to structural integrity issues such as corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. In present work an attempt has been made to study the effect of 309L austenitic filler on the mechanical and microstructural properties of X70 and 2205 duplex stainless steel dissimilar weld fabricated by metal inert gas welding process (MIG). Impact toughness, hardness, corrosion and microstructure of X70 + 2205 dissimilar weld was studied.

ID PARAMETERS; NICKEL; DEPOSITION; JOINTS; STATE
AB An increasing number of applications of microelectronics products involve multiple reflows and/or extended operation at temperatures high enough that intermetallic growth in the solder joints becomes a concern even on Ni surfaces. Recent work has shown the evolution of large voids between the Ni3Sn4 intermetallic compound and the solder. It was also suggested that the buildup of stresses due to the Kirkendall effect makes this void formation "inevitable" once the Ni3Sn4 thickness has grown to more to more than 5 mu m. In a systematic study we find that no voids of any kind are observed in solder joints on high-purity Ni pads, while voiding of different levels of severity is seen upon soldering on electroplated Ni depending on specific processing conditions. We show that while the void growth may result in Ni stress relaxation, the void nucleation is associated with gasification of impurities and/or hydrogen in the Ni during reflow. This is evidenced by the fact that all voiding could be prevented by annealing of electroplated Ni pads to 450 degrees C for 24 h prior to soldering. We argue that, upon nucleation, voids do indeed grow further by coalescence of Kirkendall vacancies created by the disparity of Ni and Sn diffusion fluxes in aging, but the nucleation mechanism renders the voiding propensity controllable and eventually preventable. We discuss the minimization of voiding by control of Ni electroplating and reflow process parameters.

AB The development of NiO-based molecular photocathodes is attracting more interest in the field of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for efficient conversion of sunlight into fuel. For this purpose, different strategies are developed to assemble the molecular components together to build functional devices. Here, an original dye/catalyst supramolecular assembly was designed and obtained via axial coordination of a cobalt-based H-2-evolving catalyst, i.e., a cobaloxime complex, to a pyridyl-functionalized ruthenium-diacetylide photosensitizer. The new supramolecular assembly was successfully employed for the construction of efficient NiO-based photocathodes for solar hydrogen production. We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of the new photocatalytic system, including electrochemical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Photoelectrochemical generation of H-2 under pertinent aqueous conditions eventually led to a faradaic efficiency of 27%.

AB The interactions of the lignin model, the lignin oligomer with degree of polymerization n = 2, with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid were investigated through DFT calculations in detail. Computational results revealed that lignin dissolution in ionic liquids should be a result of the joint interactions of lignin with anion and cation of ionic liquid, and the formation of ion pair weakens the interactions between lignin and ionic liquid components. Unlike the dominant H-bonds within the lignin-anion interactions, the lignin-cation interactions involve a combination of hydrogen bond and pi-stacking. These results would provide mechanistic insights and suggestions for lignocellulosic dissolution in ionic liquids.

AB Oxygen-free copper (Cu) was successfully joined to carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP, polyamide 6 with 20 wt% carbon fiber addition) by friction lap joining (FLJ) at joining speeds of 200-1600 mm/min with a constant rotation rate of 1500 rpm and a nominal plunge depth of 0.9 mm. It is the first time to report the joining of CFRTP to Cu by FLJ. As the joining speed increased, the tensile shear force (TSF) of joints increased first, and decreased thereafter. The maximum TSF could reach 2.3 kN (15 mm in width). Hydrogen bonding formed between the amide group of CFRTP and the thin Cu2O layer on the Cu surface, which mainly contributed to the joint bonding. The influence factors of the TSF of the joints at different joining speeds were discussed. The TSF was mainly affected by the joining area, the degradation of the plastic matrix and the number and the size of bubbles. As the joining speed increased, the influence factors varied as follows: the joining area increased first and then decreased; the degradation of the plastic matrix and the number and the size of bubbles decreased. The maximum TSF was the comprehensive result of the relatively large joining area, small degradation of the plastic matrix and small number and sizes of bubbles.

AB Plants encounter several abiotic stresses, among which heat stress is gaining paramount attention because of the changing climatic conditions. Severe heat stress conspicuously reduces crop productivity through changes in metabolic processes and in growth and development. Ethylene and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are signaling molecules involved in defense against heat stress through modulation of biomolecule synthesis, the antioxidant system, and post-translational modifications. Other compounds containing the essential mineral nutrient sulfur (S) also play pivotal roles in these defense mechanisms. As biosynthesis of ethylene and H2S is connected to the S-assimilation pathway, it is logical to consider the existence of a functional interplay between ethylene, H2S, and S in relation to heat stress tolerance. The present review focuses on the crosstalk between ethylene, H2S, and S to highlight their joint involvement in heat stress tolerance.

H2S is involved in the whole life cycle of plants orderly, regulating essential plant processes such as seed germination, root growth, flowering, anti-aging of post-ripening by affecting corresponding gene expression and subsequent enzyme activities, as well as crosstalk with plant hormones and other signaling molecules. The research on H2S physiology entering an exponential exploration era, with significant progress has been made on many fronts of H2S function. However, the research on its molecular mechanism is still fragmented. In this review, we collect recent up-dates from physiological function to molecular biological mechanism of biological processes for H2S participating throughout plants' life cycle, and present a brief outlook for future research.

AB Polypropylene (PP) is wildly used to light the weight of advanced cars and vehicles due to its good resistance to abrasion and wear, high flexibility, and excellent impact strength. However, PP macromolecules consist of long chains of carbon atoms attached to hydrogen atoms. The non-functional surfaces of PP make it hard to achieve stable hybrid structures with metals. Current work reported an interfacial design strategy to manufacture highreliability PP/A6061-T6 aluminum alloy (6061) hybrid structures by friction assisted welding (FAW). To achieve this, carboxy group (COOH) was grafted on PP while the surficial microstructure was built on 6061. The introducing carboxy group reacted with 6061 to develop interfacial covalent and hydrogen bonds. The built surface microstructures of 6061 not only realized the mechanical interlock at PP/6061 interfaces but also improved the compatibility between PP and 6061. The surface microstructures enabled the good wetting and fast spread of melt PP to provide sufficient reaction area and time for the development of interfacial chemical interaction. Compared with other developed methods, our interfacial design strategy enhances the reliability of metal-thermoplastic hybrid structures with low equipment, process, materials, and environmental costs, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications. Current work provides a simple yet attractive strategy for achieving high-reliability joints between dissimilar metals and thermoplastics.

AB Aqueous solution of a fluoride ion at 300 K is studied using the method of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Instantaneous fluctuations in vibrational frequencies of local OD stretch modes of deuterated water are calculated using a time-series analysis of the simulated trajectory. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the first and second solvation shells and also in bulk of the aqueous fluoride ionic solution are studied through calculations of the frequency time correlation function (FTCF), joint probability distributions, slope of three pulse photon echo (S3PE) and two dimensional infrared spectrum (2D-IR). The vibrational spectral dynamics in the first solvation shell shows decay with three components which can be correlated with the dynamics of intact ion-water hydrogen bonds, ion-water hydrogen bond lifetime and the escape dynamics of water molecules from the solvation shell. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the second solvation shell and in the bulk show very similar decay behavior. The timescales obtained from FTCF, S3PE and the slope of nodal line (SNL) of 2D-IR are found to be in reasonable agreement with each others.

AB Mo-Mn metallization of alumina ceramics of different purity has been performed at 1400 degrees C for 10 min in moist hydrogen and nitrogen atmosphere. Nickel coating has been applied onto the metallized alumina ceramics at 1000 degrees C for 1 h in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere. Finally, metallized and nickel coated alumina ceramics has been brazed with another metallized and nickel coated alumina ceramics using CuAg filler alloy at 900 degrees C for 10 min in a vacuum furnace at 1 x 10(-6) Ton pressure. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis has been carried out for phase analysis, microstructural investigation and elemental composition analysis. The adhesive strength of the metallizing layer and brazing strength of the joint have been measured by pull down breaking strength method. SEM study has shown that the width of the interfacial reaction region between the metallizing layer and substrate enhances with increasing the impurity content in the alumina ceramics. It has been observed that the adhesive strength of the metallizing layer depends on the interfacial reaction layer thickness. The adhesive strength of the metallizing layer has been increased with increasing the thickness of interfacial reaction layer. High adhesive strength of the metallizing layer as well as brazing strength has been achieved for alumina ceramics with high impurity content.

AB Given the current strict regulations on fuel emissions, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been considered as ideal non-polluting vehicles. As the kernel subsystem of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the fuel cell engine, which is a complex system, may fail because of multiple competing failure causes. In fuel cell engine reliability engineering, discriminating and measuring dependency among multiple failure causes is an urgent problem that should be addressed. This study proposes a statistical dependency analysis model under competing risks based on reliability field data of fuel cell engines. The multivariate lognormal distribution is employed to model joint failure distribution. Then, using simulated annealing algorithm to estimate the parameters of the conditional probability likelihood function. Moreover, p-value hypothesis test procedures are developed to determine the significance of the dependence degree among multiple competing failure causes. In this article, the failure mechanisms of fuel cell engine are comprehensively discussed to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results can provide technical support for studies on optimal maintenance strategies.

AB Two high density structures beta- and gamma-LiAlH4 are detected in LiAlH4, a promising hydrogen storage compound, upon compression in diamond anvil cells, investigated with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and first-principle calculations. The joint of the experimental and theoretical results has confirmed the sequence of the pressure-induced structural phase transitions from alpha-LiAlH4 (space group P2(1)/c) to beta-LiAlH4 (P2(1)/c-6C symmetry), and then to gamma-LiAlH4 (space group Pnc2), which are not reported in previous literatures. At the alpha to beta transition point for LiAlH4, the estimated difference in cell volume is about 20%, while the transformation from beta to gamma phase is with a volume drop smaller than 1%. The alpha to beta phase transition is accompanied by the local structure change from a AlH4 tetrahedron into a AlH6 octahedron, which contributes to a large volume collapse.

   cold cracking risk
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD

DT Article
DE Repair welding; MAG welding; High-strength steels; Cold cracking;
   Residual stresses
ID RESIDUAL-STRESS
AB The sustainable and resource-efficient production of wind energy plants requires the use of modern high-strength fine-grain structural steels. This applies to both foundation and erection structures, like mobile or ship cranes. During the assembly of steel structures, unacceptable defects can occasionally be found in the weld area. In most cases, the economical solution would be local thermal gouging of the affected areas and re-welding. Due to the high shrinkage restraint of the joint groove in the overall structure, the superposition of global and local welding-induced stresses may lead to crack formation and component failure, particularly in interaction with the degradation of the microstructure and mechanical properties of high-strength steels during the repair process. However, manufacturers hardly have any information about these issues and there is a lack of recommendations and guidelines to take these safety-relevant aspects into account in adequate repair concepts. The aim of this research is to derive recommendations for repair concepts appropriate to the stresses and materials involved providing a basis for standards and guidelines to avoid cold cracking, damage and expensive reworking especially for high-strength steels. Part 1 of this study involves systematic investigations of influences of shrinkage restraint during repair welding of two high-strength steels S500MLO for offshore application and S960QL for mobile crane structures. The quantification of the shrinkage restraint of repair weld joints was achieved by means of experimental and numerical restraint intensity analysis. In welding experiments with self-restrained slot specimens, restraint intensity and introduction of hydrogen via the welding arc using anti spatter spray were varied systematically to analyse the effect on welding result, residual stresses and cold cracking. It could be shown that increasing restraint intensities result in significantly higher transverse residual stress levels. In the case of hydrogen introduction S500MLO showed no cold cracking independent of the restraint conditions. However, S960QL was found to be considerably cold cracking sensitive if hydrogen is introduced. With increasing restraint intensity length and number of cold cracks increases significantly. Part 2 [1] of this study is focussed on microstructure and residual stresses due to gouging and stress optimization via adequate heat control parameters in repair welding.

AB Achieving high performance conductive hydrogel sensor which is capable of combining as many advantages as possible in one is highly desired to satisfy real-world tasks. To this end, novel hydrogel sensors PVA/NaDa (polyvinyl alcohol/D-Gluconic acid sodium salt) and PVA/NaLa (polyvinyl alcohol/L-Glutamic acid monosodium salt) have been successfully constructed via a facile and effective strategy. The hydrogels realize the combination of robust mechanical properties (stress, strain, elastic modulus, toughness, fatigue resistance, anti-breakage ability and recovery performance), excellent conductivity, sensitive sensitivity, rapid response capacity and high cytocompatibility. The increasing hydrogen bond cross-linking density and hydrogen bond interactions of NaDa (NaLa) with PVA are mainly responsible for significantly intensified mechanical properties of PVA/NaDa and PVA/NaLa hydrogels. Benefiting from the prominent performances, the hydrogels can be processed into flexible membrane sensors to not only effectively detect the human joint motions but also sensitively simulate manual control of the mobile phone screen for writing text, demonstrating a promising application in multifunctional intelligent robots, electronic skins, artificial intelligence and among others.

TI Application of C-Terminal 7-Azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane to Stabilize
   β-Strand-like Extended Conformation of a Neighboring α-Amino Acid

AB beta-Strands are formed by extended linear peptide chains that are usually paired to form beta-sheet structure through interstrand hydrogen bonding. Linking a structured organic molecule with alpha-amino acid(s) can enforce or stabilize beta-strand-like extended structures of the jointed amino acids. Spectroscopic and simulation studies indicated that the presence of a Cterminal 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane amine (Abh) favors a beta-strand-like extended conformation of the adjacent alpha-amino acid on the N side. The bridgehead substitution of the Abh unit biases the amide cis-trans equilibrium of the adjacent alpha-amino acid residue to cis conformation. The proximity, specified by the presence of bond paths (such as H-H bond path) between the bridgehead proton of Abh and the alpha-proton of the alpha-amino acid provides a driving force favoring the extended conformation, which is independent of solvents. These results provide a basis for de novo design of beta-strand-mimicking extended peptides by using beta-strand enforcer/stabilizer even in the absence of the interstrand hydrogen bonding.

AB Ketol-isomerases catalyze the reversible isomerization between aldoses and ketoses. D-Xylose isomerase carries out the first reaction in the catabolism of D-xylose, but is also able to convert D-glucose to D-fructose. The first step of the reaction is an enzyme-catalyzed ring opening of the cyclic substrate. The active-site amino-acid acid/base pair involved in ring opening has long been investigated and several models have been proposed. Here, the structure of the xylose isomerase E1860 mutant with cyclic glucose bound at the active site, refined against joint X-ray and neutron diffraction data, is reported. Detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks at the active site of the enzyme suggests that His54, which is doubly protonated, is poised to protonate the glucose 05 position, while Lys289, which is neutral, promotes deprotonation of the glucose O1H hydroxyl group via an activated water molecule. The structure also reveals an extended hydrogen-bonding network that connects the conserved residues Lys289 and Lys183 through three structurally conserved water molecules and residue 186, which is a glutamic acid to glutamine mutation.

AB The possible interactions near the triple-phase boundaries (TPB) metal/glass/air, and their effects on joint strength are investigated. Two types of samples (joined couples and glass coated coupons) are prepared with the coupon of AISI 430 (nickel plated and uncoated) and a slurry of compliant silicate sealing glass (SCN-1). The joined and coated samples are heated at 850 degrees C for 1000 h in air. The joined couples are cooled using two different schedules and then tested in uniaxial tension. For investigating the metal-oxides precipitation procedure in glass near the TPB, glass coated coupons are either cooled at the rate of 5 degrees C min(-1) or water-quenched from aging temperature. The mechanical test results and microstructural observations show that the spread and accelerated breakaway oxidation near TPB, which is due to continuous oxidation and dissolution of ferritic stainless steel (FSS) into the glass, leads to decreased and scattered low temperature joint strengths.

AB The IBARAKI biological crystal diffractometer (iBIX) was used in single-crystal time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments on manganese catalase from Thermus thermophilus. The unit-cell dimensions were 133 x 133 x 133 angstrom, which is close to the designed maximum limitation of iBIX (135 x 135 x 135 angstrom). The optimum integration box sizes were set and the degree of integration box overlap was calculated for each Laue spot. Using the overlap ratio as the criterion, the selection of the diffraction intensity data was performed to give a minimum R-p.i.m.. Subsequently, diffraction intensity data from Laue spots with overlap ratios <= 0.1 were selected and a complete reflection data set with d(min) = 2.35 angstrom was obtained. Joint X-ray and neutron structure refinements were also successfully performed. It was difficult to determine the structures and protonation states of all the oxygen atoms in the manganese cluster owing to the disordered structure. No hydrogen atom was observed on the ordered mu -bridging oxygen atom O1003. Instead, this oxygen atom probably forms a hydrogen bond with Thr39. In addition, the refinements clearly showed the protonation states of the amino acid residues and hydrogen bonds, as observed in Tyr192, Glu167 and Glu280. This first neutron crystal structure of manganese catalase shows that iBIX can provide acceptable diffraction data for neutron single-crystal analyses of at least 2.4 angstrom resolution within the original targeted unit-cell dimensions of 135 x 135 x 135 angstrom.

AB The conductive hydrogel as a flexible sensor not only has certain mechanical flexibility but also can be used in the field of human health detection and human-computer interaction. Herein, by introduction of tannic acid (TA) with MXene into the polyacrylamide (PAM)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) double-network hydrogel, a hydrogel with high stretchability, self-adhesion, and high sensitivity was prepared. CMC and PAM form a semi-interpenetrating double-network of high toughness and durability through electrostatic interactions and multiple hydrogen bonding networks. The abundant hydrophilic functional groups on TA and MXene form multiple hydrogen bonds simultaneously with the polymer network, ensuring high stretchability and sensitivity of the hydrogel. The hydrogel can display an accurate response to a variety of stimulus signals and can monitor both human joint movements and small physiological signal changes. It can also be combined with deep learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits with an accuracy rate of 98%. This work can promote the application of hydrogel sensors with durability and high sensitivity. The combination of algorithms and flexible sensors provides important ideas for the further development of flexible devices.

AB To quantify the water absorbed by wheat in different soil layers and improve both wheat yields and water use efficiency (WUE), a 2-year conservation tillage and straw treatment experiment was implemented. This experiment involved four tillage methods, conventional tillage (C), subsoiling (S), rotary tillage (R), and no-tillage (N), and two straw treatments, straw return (W) and no straw return (0). The hydrogen, oxygen and carbon stable isotope method was used to evaluate the water source, grain yield, dry matter quantity and WUE of wheat as well as the relationships between Delta C-13 values of the wheat leaves, stems, ears and yield and the WUE under different tillage and straw treatment methods at the jointing and harvest stages. The results indicated that wheat water uptake occurred mainly within the 0-20 cm (86.22 %) soil layer at the jointing stage and within the 0-20 (56.36 %) and 20-40 cm (38.74 %) soil layers at the harvest stage. Compared with those in the C-0 treatment, the dry matter quantity in the S-W treatment increased by 14.86 % and 14.20 % respectively, at the jointing stage and the harvest stage; the grain yield in the S-W treatment significantly increased by 18 % at the harvest stage (P < 0.05); the WUEt and WUE, in the S-W treatment significantly increased by 46.21 % and 45.31 %, respectively, at the jointing stage (P < 0.05); and the WUEy increased by 5.69 % and 5.54 %, respectively, at the jointing stage and the harvest stage. The Delta C-13 vales of the wheat leaves, stems and ears were positively correlated with the yield, dry matter quantity and WUE of wheat. In conclusion, subsoiling with straw return should be adopted as a promising strategy for improving both wheat productivity and WUE and for retaining soil water availability. The Delta C-13 value of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes in wheat yield and WUE.

TI Enzyme-mediated multifunctional self-healing lysozyme hydrogel for
   synergistic treatment of chronic diabetic wounds

AB Self-healing hydrogels have attracted significant attention in chronic diabetic wound healing due to their potential to minimize the risk of secondary infections caused by joint movement or dressing rupture. Herein, a multifunctional self-healing hydrogel mediated utilizing an enzyme-triggered cascade reaction based on dynamic imine bonds was designed. The hydrogel employs three enzymes: lysozyme (LYZ), glucose oxidase (GOx), and catalase (CAT), as building blocks. GOx catalyzes the conversion of glucose and 1-thio-beta-D-glucose (beta-GlcSH) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), gluconic acid (GA), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Subsequently, CAT eliminates H2O2, protecting the imine bonds from oxidative damage. The acidic environment created by GA decreases the pH and regulates the crosslinking density of imine bonds, enhancing the self-healing capability and porosity of the hydrogel. This feature enables the sustained release of the drug rosuvastatin calcium (RCa) to promote endothelial cell migration and vascular regeneration. Combined with the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of released H2S gas and the antibacterial properties of lysozyme, this hydrogel exhibits promising therapeutic efficacy for the synergistic treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.

ID SELECTIVE OXIDATION; G-C3N4; EVOLUTION
AB g-C3N4 as a new metal-free photocatalytic material for water splitting has attracted much attention in recent years, but its photocatalytic efficiency needs further improvement. Here we synthesized novel C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalytic materials with high hydrogen generation ability for water splitting under visible light radiation (lambda > 420 nm). These materials take full advantage of the electron conduction expressing of graphene and the superior-strong electron-attracting ability of C-60. The mutually-reinforcing synergy between graphene and C-60 improves the migration and utilization efficiency of photo-generated electrons and accelerates the separation of photo-generated charges, thus significantly enhancing the hydrogen generation capacity of g-C3N4. The hydrogen production amount and rate of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60 and graphene) after 10 h are 5449.5 mu mol/g and 545 mu mol/g/h, which is 539.6 times of pure g-C3N4 under the same condition. The values are 50.8 and 4.24 times of graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L graphene) and C-60/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60), respectively. The apparent quantum yield of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 (10 mg/L C-60 and graphene) in 97 h is about 7.2%. The improvement of hydrogen generation activity in 97 h suggests the high long-time stability of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 in photocatalytic water spitting. The photocatalytic ability of C-60/graphene/g-C3N4 can be controlled by regulating the addition of graphene and C-60. The mutually-reinforcing synergy between graphene and C-60 was proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum and organic electron acceptors of MV2+. Thus, the joint action of C-60 and graphene promotes the migration, separation and utilization of photo-generated electrons, which is responsible for the significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous neuromodulator produced mainly by the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) in peripheral tissues. A pronociceptive role of endogenously produced H2S has been previously reported by our group in a model of orofacial inflammatory pain. Using the established persistent orofacial pain rat model induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into temporomandibular joint (TMJ), we have now investigated the putative role of endogenous H2S modulating hypemociceptive responses. Additionally, plasmatic extravasation on TMJ was measured following different treatments by Evans blue dye quantification. Thus, rats were submitted to Von Frey and Formalin tests in orofacial region before and after pharmacological inhibition of the CSE-H2S system combined or not with CFA-induced TMJ inflammation. Pretreatment with CSE inhibitor, propargylglycine (PAG; 88.4 mu mol/kg) reduced temporomandibular inflammatory pain when injected locally as well as systemically. In particular, local PAG injection seems to be more effective for hypemociceptive responses in orofacial persistent inflammation since its action is evidenced in the majority analyzed periods of the inflammatory process compared to its systemic use. Moreover, local injection seems to act on temporomandibular vascular permeability, evidenced by decreased plasmatic extra vacation induced by local PAG administration. Our data are consistent with the notion that the endogenous synthetized gas H2S modulates persistent orofacial pain responses revealing the pharmacological importance of the CSE inhibitor as a possible therapeutic target for their control.

AB Laser-electrochemical hybrid machining (LECM) is promising in the processing of thin-wall parts, which avoids problems such as the weak stiffness of structures and thermal defects. However, while most studies focus on precision machining via LECM, few investigate the potential of this technique in macro-area processing. In this paper, the synergistic effects on the coupling of thermal field and electrochemical field on bulk material removal mechanisms in the LECM of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V are comprehensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. According to the experimental results, LECM improved the material removal rate (MRR) by up to 28.6% compared to ECM. The induction of the laser increases local heating, accelerating the temperature rise of the electrolyte, eventually promoting the electrochemical reaction. The hydrogen bubble flow promotes overall heat convection between the electrode and workpiece, which facilitates the removal of the facial precipitates and increases the efficiency of electrochemical dissolution. Higher voltages and laser powers promote the formation of hydrogen bubble flow; meanwhile, they also aggravate laser energy scattering, limiting the overall machining efficiency. Additionally, laser irradiation causes the ablation and rupture of hydrogen bubbles, which weakens the bubble flow effect and ultimately decreases the material removal efficiency. This study reveals the underlying mechanisms of the joint effects of the laser field and electrical field in LECM, and the findings can provide valuable insights for the optimization of LECM parameters in industrial applications.

AB Background: Thorough irrigation and debridement using an irrigation solution is a well-established treatment for both acute and chronic periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). In the absence of concrete data, identifying the optimal irrigation agent and protocol remains challenging. Methods: A thorough review of the current literature on the various forms of irrigations and their additives was performed to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of each solution as pertaining to pathogen eradication in the treatment of PJI. As there is an overall paucity of high-quality literature comparing irrigation additives to each other and to any control, no meta-analyses could be performed. The literature was therefore summarized in this review article to give readers concise information on current irrigation options and their known risks and benefits. Results: Antiseptic solutions include povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, and preformulated commercially available combination solutions. The current literature suggests that intraoperative use of antiseptic irrigants may play a role in treating PJI, but definitive clinical studies comparing antiseptic to no antiseptic irrigation are lacking. Furthermore, no clinical head-to-head comparisons of different antiseptic irrigants have identified an optimal irrigation solution. Conclusion: Further high-quality studies on the optimal irrigation additive and protocol for the management of PJI are warranted to guide future evidence-based decisions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUNDThe background of this study was analgesia in natural delivery. The combined spinal-epidural anesthesia has obvious analgesic effect on the parturients in natural labor, and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia has been widely used in anesthesia for various diseases.AIMTo study the effects of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia on anxiety, labor analgesia, and motor blocks in parturients during natural delivery.METHODSA total of 120 women who gave birth at Changning District Maternal and Child Health Hospital between December 2021 to December 2022 were included; a random number table approach was employed to divide the women into a control group and a joint group, with each group consisting of 60 women. The control group was given epidural anesthesia, while the joint group was given combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of maternal pain. Comparisons were made between the two groups' conditions of childbirth and the duration of labor. Apgar scores were used to evaluate the status of the newborns at birth; Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) scores, umbilical artery blood gas analysis indices and stress indices were compared between the two groups; and the frequencies of motor block and postpartum complications were analyzed.RESULTSIn comparison to the control group, in the joint group, the VAS scores for the first, second, and third stages of labor were lower (P < 0.05). The rates of conversion to cesarean section and postpartum blood loss in the joint group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the Apgar score, the duration of the first stage of labor, or the total duration of labor between the two groups (P > 0.05). The second and third stages of labor in the joint group were shorter than those in the control group (P < 0.05). When compared to the control group, the postpartum SAS score of the joint group was lower, while the GSES score was greater (P < 0.05). Between the control group and the joint group, the differences observed in pH, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, arterial oxygen partial pressure, or arterial hydrogen ion concentration were not significant (P > 0.05). Nitric oxide, cortisol, and adrenaline levels were lower in the joint group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no substantial differences in Bromage grade or rate of complications between the two groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONFor parturients during natural delivery, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia can reduce anxiety, provide labor analgesia, shorten labor time, and reduce postoperative stress levels but did not result in a motor block.

AB The anisotropic structure and dynamics of the hydration shell of a benzene solute in liquid water have been investigated by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using the BLYP (Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr) and dispersion corrected BLYP-D functionals. The main focus has been to look at the influence of pi-hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions on the distance and angle resolved various structural and dynamic properties of solvation shell. The structure of hydration shell water molecules around benzene is found to be highly anisotropic as revealed by the radial distribution functions of different conical regions and joint radial/angular distribution functions. The benzene water dimer potential energy curves are calculated for a variety of orientations of water along the axial and equatorial directions for both BLYP and BLYP-D functionals. The simulation results of the hydration shell structure of benzene, particularly the axial and equatorial benzene water RDFs are discussed based on the differences in the benzene water potential energies for different orientations and functionals. The inter-particle distance/angle correlations show an enhanced water structure in the solvation shell of benzene compared to that between the solvation shell and bulk and also between the bulk molecules. On average, a single pi H-bond is found to be formed between water and benzene in the 45 axial conical region of the solvation shell. The pi H-bonded water molecules are found to have faster translational dynamics and also found to follow a fast jump mechanism of reorientation to change their hydrogen bonded partners. The presence of pi-hydrogen-bonded water makes the overall dynamics of the axial region faster than that of the equatorial region where the water molecules are hydrophobically solvated and hydrogen bonded to other water molecules.

AB We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modelling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching , N similar to 10(5) which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrument terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.

AB With the growing adoption of renewable energy resources, microgrids (MGs) are increasingly relying on these sources to meet their electrical load demands. To ensure efficient operation, these units must be scheduled in a coordinated manner. This paper introduces a stochastic model for the joint scheduling of renewable and thermal energy units. The study focuses on integrating proton exchange membrane fuel cell-based combined heat and power (PEMFC-CHP) units, wind turbines (WTs), and photovoltaic (PV) systems within the scheduling framework. Additionally, hydrogen storage strategies are incorporated into the PEMFC-CHP operations. The model addresses uncertainties such as wind speed, solar irradiance, and market price fluctuations using a scenariobased approach. The proposed method formulates the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) model, incorporating hydrogen storage strategies. The inherent uncertainties in these parameters further transform the problem into a stochastic MINP. Coordinated scheduling of renewable and thermal units within microgrids not only optimizes resource utilization but also enhances the overall objective function value. These advancements align with current energy policy objectives aimed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of energy systems. To solve the complex scheduling problem, this research employs an Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA), which has been tested on a modified 33-bus distribution network. Simulation results indicate that the ISSA achieves over 5% higher revenue compared to other optimization methods. Furthermore, incorporating combined heat and power (CHP) operations increases the total system profit by more than 15%. The algorithm achieved the optimal result in 28 out of 30 attempts. The ISSA algorithm, with a remarkable success rate of 95.28%, demonstrates its effectiveness in minimizing MG operating costs, a critical component of energy policy goals.

AB Droughts not only reduce the biomass of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) but also increase the risk of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) toxicity to animals, mainly due to increased HCN content in drought-stressed plants. In the present study, the variations of HCN contents in 12 sorghum genotypes (10 sweet sorghum cultivars, one Sudangrass and one forage sorghum) were investigated at jointing, filling and ripening stages under rainfed conditions. Next, three genotypes - one sweet sorghum, one Sudangrass and one forage sorghum - were further selected to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of plant growth regulators (PGRs) (abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)) in mitigating the concentrations of HCN in drought-stressed plants in a pot experiment. About 100 mu g/L ABA and 100 mu g/L MeJA were sprayed separately or together twice on drought-stressed (50 and 75% field water capacity) plant leaf. The drought lasted for 15 days. In the field experiment the HCN content in plants reduced from jointing to filling stages then increased from filling to ripening stages in several cultivars. In the pot experiment, drought increased the HCN accumulation and soluble protein content in leaves of all three genotypes. PGRs overall reduced the HCN contents in drought-stressed sweet sorghum and Sudangrass but not in forage sorghum (except in the ABA+MeJA treatment). However, the soluble protein contents were reduced by PGRs in drought-stressed forage sorghum but not in sweet sorghum (except in the ABA+MeJA treatment) and Sudangrass. Both ABA and MeJA increased the plant weights, whereas only MeJA enhanced net photosynthetic rate (P-N) in all three genotypes. PGRs reduced release rate of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in all drought-stressed plants, and reduced the activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase in sweet sorghum but not in other two genotypes. These results suggest that exogenous ABA and MeJA could increase plant weight and reduce HCN content in drought-stressed sorghums, with varying physiological responsive mechanisms among sorghum genotypes.

AB This paper presents a mini-review of investigations performed by the authors in the field of hydrodynamic theory of lubrication of biological systems and synthetic processing of results to indicate the influence of biologically live material properties on biological liquid viscosity variations.
   The goal of the presented study was to demonstrate a new principle of a general mathematical theory applied to the mechanism of hydrodynamic lubrication of human joint cartilage surfaces with phospholipids bilayer and to indicate analytical solutions of hydrodynamic pressure, temperature and bio-fluid velocity components. Moreover, 3D variations of dynamic synovial fluid viscosity are assessed, particularly its variations across the entire film thickness.
   A new 3D analytical and numerical model has been elaborated on the basis of tribology methods, based on the assumptions of an ultra-thin boundary layer of non-Newtonian fluid. The analysed elements also included phospholipid concentrations, power hydrogen ion and collagen fiber concentrations in synovial, biological fluids, as well as electrostatic field, cartilage or biological surface wettability.
   The obtained results of our analysis demonstrate relationships which occur among hydrodynamic pressure, human joint load carrying capacity and phospholipid bilayer in the cartilage superficial layer. According to the best knowledge of the Authors, the obtained results may find applications in a broad scope of spatiotemporal models in biology and health science.

AB In the present work, a solid state environment-friendly methodology has been adopted to produce self-healing elastomers using commercial tire-grade polybutadiene rubber (BR) and butyl rubber (IIR). The elastomeric chains were directly grafted with optimized dosages of maleic anhydride followed by reactive mixing with ring opening amine-based adducts (e.g., 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole) to create acid/amide-based supramolecular cooperative hydrogen bonds between elastomer chains, without any adverse effect on the intrinsic properties of the elastomers. Thus, modified elastomers in gum state were found to be have supramolecular cross-linking, that is, without applying any conventional vulcanizing agents. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of Modified BR, that is, BR-g-MAH (Tz) were enhanced by similar to 3.5% and similar to 7.5% respectively compared to commercial BR due to incorporation of hydrogen bonding network. The modified elastomers were also found to be thermo-responsive in which micro-cracks were healed in presence of thermal stimuli. Such healing could have been observed due to presence of reversible hydrogen-bonding based dissociation and association phenomenon. The thermo-reversible supramolecular hydrogen bonding was observed in H-1 NMR spectroscopy as well. Furthermore, such modified BR, when utilized in different pneumatic tire formulations, significantly improvement in dynamic property was observed as compared to tire formulation made using commercial grade BR. The modified elastomer showed potential to replace the commercial-grade elastomers for various conventional elastomers applications especially in tire sidewalls, tire tread etc. Additionally, such modified BR may improve tire life cycle, and thereby, reduces tire-waste generation. It may also find applications in non-tire sectors like conveyer belts, sealing joints, impact protection etc.

AB The methyl-substituted furan derivatives 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) are often discussed as alternative fuels. Despite the large number of mechanistic studies on the pyrolysis and oxidation of 2-MF, 2,5-DMF, and unsubstituted furan (F), detailed kinetic investigations of the initial reaction steps are scarce. In this work, we report on shock-tube studies with detection of hydrogen atoms by atom resonance absorption spectroscopy to investigate the thermal decomposition of F, 2-MF, and 2,5-DMF. Hydrogen atom concentration-time profiles were recorded behind reflected shock waves at temperatures between 1200 and 1900 K and pressures between 0.7 and 1.6 bar with Ar as the bath gas. The recorded profiles were compared with results from kinetic simulations performed on the basis of a joint F/2-MF/2,5-DMF oxidation mechanism recently published. Kinetic parameters for a small number of reactions with high sensitivities for the formation and consumption of H atoms were adapted by taking values from other references to improve the agreement of the experimentally determined and simulated concentration-time profiles. In this way, an adequate description of the H atom concentration-time profiles for all three furan derivatives with the joint mechanism could be achieved. On the basis of this adapted mechanism, the formation pathways of H atoms in the pyrolysis of all three furan derivatives were identified and analyzed. It turned out that the formation of H atoms in the case of 2-MF and 2,5-DMF is governed by a competition between H split-off from the methyl group(s) of the reactant molecule as well as from the primary ring-opening product. In the case of F, only decomposition steps of the ring-opening product are relevant. The adapted mechanism is given in machine-readable form for modeling purposes, and the alterations made are discussed.

AB In this paper, a damaged fire tube of H-500 vessel in Naftshahr operational area was investigated. The damages were reported as circumferential cracks at the joint of the fire tube to oval flange, which was led to leakage at U-turn section, local corrosion at the welding lines and observing scales at the outer surfaces of the fire tube. Microstructure studies were conducted at different zones (base metal, HAZ, welding line and cracked areas) for a cracked U-turn of the fire tube using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM/EDS analysis. The results showed that the initial microstructure of the fire tube was laminar ferritic-pearlitic, whereas, the heat affected zone of the welding line contained grain boundary and Widmanstatten ferrite. MnS particles were also seen in the microstructure with elongated morphology and circumferential cracks. At the HAZ of welding lines, step-wise cracking was observed as an accumulation of the voids around MnS particles. This could be an indicative of hydrogen induced cracking (HIC).
   Mechanical properties (hardness, impact energy and tensile strength) of the four studied zones were investigated and showed that all the properties were in agreement with the standard values for ASTM A516 Gr 70 N, the steel of the fire tube, and their variation was based on the microstructural evolution. Therefore, these results showed no probability of hydrogen embrittlement.

AB To obtain the optimal hydrogen-driven chemical reaction process for the preparation of Mg2Si as an anodic material of Li-ion batteries, the effects of the dehydrogenation temperatures on the structure and electrochemical properties are systematically investigated. The results indicate that Mg2Si prepared by isothermal dehydrogenation at 310 and 330 A degrees C exhibit better cycling stability than the samples prepared at 290 and 350 A degrees C due to the joint effects of the product purity and the particle size, especially for the 330 A degrees C-prepared sample. In particular, the initial discharge capacity of the Mg2Si prepared at 330 A degrees C is 1010 mAh/g with a coulombic efficiency of 92 %. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity is approximately 416 mAh/g and the corresponding capacity retention is calculated to be approximately 41 %.

AB We report a joint experimental and theoretical studyon the reactivityof Ag- n  (+) clusters with H2S, D2O, and NH3. Complete dehydrogenationproducts are observed for Ag- n  (+) reacting with H2S, but no dehydrogenation products arefound for D2O or NH3 under the same reactioncondition. Theoretical calculations elucidate why Ag- n  (+) clusters show different reactivities with theseinorganic hydrides. NH3 shows strong coordination withAg( n ) (+), but the dehydrogenationreactions are unfavorable; in contrast, the fragile H-S bondsand stable Ag n S+ products facilitatethe hydrogen evolution of H2S on Ag- n  (+). We fully analyzed the metal-ligand interactionsof Ag- n  (+) clusters with threemolecules and illustrated the reaction dynamics and charge-transferinteractions and altered the superatomic states during the formationof cluster sulfides. We expect this study to benefit the design ofstable environmentally friendly desulfurization catalysts and alsothe understanding of the mechanism on ligand-protected metal clustersin wet chemistry.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is an irreversible disease of continuous degradation of cartilage, and natural joint super-lubrication is thought to provide hydrated lubrication to articular cartilage. Synovial joint fluid consists of hyaluronic acid (HA) and numerous brush-like macromolecules, exhibits a high affinity for cartilage proteins, and forms a hydrated layer on the cartilage surface. When cartilage friction increases, the surface layer of the cartilage becomes ruptured or damaged, and the cartilage hydration layer is destroyed, subsequently evolving into early OA. In this study, dopamine (DOPA) was coupled with HA to modify it by utilizing the hydrophilicity of HA and the adhesive properties of DOPA. On the one hand, it enhances cartilage lubrication by prolonging the retention time of HA in cartilage and restoring the hydrated layer on the cartilage surface by adhering to the type II collagen network. The successful synthesis of hyaluronic acid-DOPA (HAD) was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hydrogen spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. The morphology and hydrophilicity of HAD were demonstrated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. Additionally, the interaction of HAD with cartilage matrix proteins was verified through confocal microscopy imaging, while the biocompatibility and feasibility of injection of HAD were confirmed by cellular and animal experiments. On the other hand, the effect of protecting and even regenerating cartilage was achieved by remodeling the cartilage microenvironment. The cartilage protection and even regeneration ability of HAD was confirmed by injecting HAD at different times after OA modeling and characterizing the joints in sections.

AB The chirality of the protein backbone influences both self-assembly and biological activity. In ferrocene-containing peptides, the sequence and chirality of the constitutive amino acids as well as the structure of the ferrocene scaffold strongly influence the conformational properties, whereas the biological activity is more strongly influenced by lipophilicity. A joint spectroscopic and computational study has shown that a relatively simple structural modification, such as changing the order of two amino acids in the dipeptide sequence from Pro-Ala (III) to Ala-Pro (IV), also alters the hydrogen bonding patterns from a mostly ten-membered (beta-turn) to a seven-membered ring (gamma-turn), which affects the antiproliferative activity of the ferrocene peptidomimetics studied. A systematic approach presented in this study allowed us to highlight the relevant structural variations that could lead to increased biological activity in similar ferrocene-based bioconjugates.

AB The construction of heterojunctions is often considered an effective strategy for achieving solar driven photocatalytic decomposition of water. Graphdiyne has unique properties such as highly pi conjugated structure, ideal direct bandgap, and high charge carrier mobility, making it a candidate for ideal photocatalysts. In this work, a graphdiyne based composite catalyst GDY-Cu with ohmic contact interface was prepared through organic synthesis. Subsequently, a S-scheme heterojunction was constructed between the contact interface of WO3 nanorods with surface defects and GDY-Cu samples to promote electron transfer. The hydrogen evolution ability of GDYCu/WO3 samples with different ratios was studied by adjusting the addition amount of GDY-Cu. In addition, GDY-Cu/WO3 samples exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, reaching 12.2 times that of pure GDY. In fact, the joint construction of Ohmic junctions and S-scheme heterojunctions provides a unique transport pathway for electron transfer. The built-in electric field between interfaces provides power for electron migration. Importantly, in-depth research on in-situ XPS and density functional theory calculations has confirmed the charge transfer pathway. Thorough charge dynamics analysis of the migration ability of photo generated charge carriers. This work not only enriches the photocatalytic system by integrating Ohmic junctions and S-scheme heterojunctions, but also provides a new design strategy for constructing graphdiyne based materials.

AB The HeH+ ion was the first molecule to form in the early Universe, and its comparatively large dipole moment renders it a potential coolant, relevant during the epoch of first star formation. The main destruction mechanisms under primordial conditions are recombination with free electrons and chemical reactions with hydrogen atoms. The latter process was believed to be slow at low temperatures, owing to a barrier forming along the reaction coordinate. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the reaction HeH+ + D -> HD+ + He that confirms the very recent proposition that the reaction is, in fact, barrierless and fast at low collision energies. The present evidence suggests that previous studies underestimated the low-temperature rate coefficient significantly because of an artifact in a widely used potential energy surface, and calls for a reassessment of the helium chemistry in the early Universe.

AB A line shape model that accounts for low-frequency fluctuations is applied to the Balmer series of the hydrogen isotopes (atomic transitions n -> 2). The plasma fluid parameters (density, temperature, etc.) are described as random variables characterized by a prescribed joint probability density function. A special emphasis is devoted to Stark broadened lines, which are sensitive to the plasma density. It is shown that fluctuations can lead to a significant increase of the line width if the fluctuation level Delta N-e/< N-e > (with < N-e > and Delta N-e being respectively the density averaged along the line-of-sight and its RMS value) is large.

AB The additive and antagonistic effects of the substrates and vapors on morphology of glycyl-glycine film were observed. The direction of joint effect significantly depends on the ability of the organic compound to form hydrogen bond. The vapors of strong H-donor or H-acceptor are able to overcome the interaction of the dipeptide molecules with substrate and change the film morphology. The Hansen solubility parameters can be used to predict the ability of vapors to initiate the self-assembly of dipeptide in solid state. The possible mechanism of glycyl-glycine self-assembly in solid state was proposed.

AB The proton-, lithium-, and sodium-bound cysteine dimers have been investigated in a joint computational and experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) study. IRMPD spectra in the 1000-2000 cm(-1) region show that protonation is localized on an amine group, and that intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs between the protonated amine and the carbonyl oxygen of the neutral Cys moiety. Alkali-bound dimers adopt structures reminiscent of those observed for the monomeric Cys center dot Li+ and Cys center dot Na+ species. Calculations of the heavier Cys(2)center dot M+ (M = K, Rb or Cs) species suggest that these are significantly less strongly bound than the lighter (M = H, Li, or Na) dimers.

AB A numerical investigation is carried out to study ignition events of different premixed stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures by hot exhaust gas jets. The simulations are performed for premixed, stoichiometric hydrogen/air, ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures in configurations relevant to safety applications. The ignition events of the different fuel/air mixtures by their corresponding exhaust gas jet are examined qualitatively analyzing processes and conditions leading to ignition. A stand-alone probability density function (PDF) method in connection with a projection method (PM) to calculate the mean pressure is used to model the turbulent flow. The transport equation for the joint velocity -turbulent frequency -scalar PDF is solved by a Monto Carlo/particle method. In order to reduce the computational costs concerning the chemical kinetics the reaction diffusion manifolds (REDIM) technique is used to get an appropriate reduced kinetic scheme.

AB Here, the diamond-like films in composite of nanostructure form are grown at low temperature (similar to 100 degrees C) from siloxane precursor incorporating silicon oxide (SiOx) moiety in amorphous carbon hydrogen (a-C:H) network using radio frequency plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (rf-PACVD) method on various substances including ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) substrates with the change in argon (Ar) carrier gas flow rate. The deposited diamondlike nanocomposite (DLN) films have been characterized using different spectroscopic techniques and tribological tests to understand the optimum deposition condition. The biocompatible nature of superior DLN film makes it a promising articulate knee and hip joint coating material.

AB To study the effect of surface physicochemical properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) on its interfacial bonding strength with adhesive, atmospheric pressure plasma treatment (APPT) using three gases (i. e., argon (Ar), nitrogen (N-2) and air (Air)) was conducted on surfaces of CFRP substrates. Atomic force microscope (AFM) observation indicates that APPT only changes the surface morphology of CFRP in a depth of tens of nanometers, and this minor change contributes little to the interfacial bonding strength of CFRP joints. X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses reveal that the release agent (mainly the -Si-CH3 group) and other contaminations on CFRP substrate surfaces were effectively removed by APPT, which improves the shear strength of CFRP joints from 8.6 MPa to 23.1 MPa. In addition, polar chemical functional groups (i.e., -NH2, -OH, -COOH) were generated on the CFRP substrate surfaces after APPT when nitrogen and air were used as plasma gases, which not only enhances the surface free energy of CFRP substrate but also combines with adhesive molecules through the form of hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds. With this mechanism, the shear strength of CFRP joints increased further to 28.7 MPa and 31.5 MPa when nitrogen and air were used as the plasma gases, respectively. After a quantitative study, the interfacial bonding strength between CFRP substrate and adhesive is expressed as a function of the concentration of -Si-CH3, -NH2 and -OH groups.

AB Bifunctional electrocatalysts with the joint merits of being highly efficient, stable, and low-cost are essential for overall water splitting applications. Herein, we reported a unique amorphous/crystalline coupling structure consisting of crystalline CoP nanocrystals with amorphous CoMoP in-situ growth on nickel foam (termed as CoP/a-CoMoP/NF). This was achieved through oxidation-phosphating in two successive steps by Keggin-type POM (H3PMo12O40) embedded into the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the precursor. The Mo doping and crystalline/amorphous coupling structures of CoP and CoMoP modulate the electronic structure, increase the electrocatalytic active sites, and promote the interfacial electron transfer, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The amorphous CoMoP serves a protective role in preventing corrosion during the electrochemical process. The catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 301 mV and 250 mV to drive a current of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively, and demonstrates excellent stability for both reactions. Furthermore, the alkaline electrolytic cell assembled with CoP/a-CoMoP/NF catalysts as both the anode and cathode requires only 1.66 V and 1.73 V to drive current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study offers a rational strategy for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mechanical mixtures of nickel oxide and iron oxide doped with small quantities of ceria and alumina (2 wt%), have been tested as suitable solids to jointly produce and purify hydrogen from an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 simulating a desulfurized biogas. Since the solid mixture constitutes a reactant within the system, most part of the experiments has been carried out in a thermogravimetric system acting as a differential reactor. Exhaust gases were continuously monitored by mass spectrometry at the exit of the thermobalance. The apparent reaction mechanism consists of a first stage in which CH4 reduces Fe2O3 (hematite) to Fe3O4 (magnetite) and NiO to metallic Ni. This newly formed metallic nickel adopts a catalytic role promoting the methane dry reforming (MDR) reaction between CH4 and CO2. Fe3O4 reduces to metallic iron (Fe-0) at the expense of H-2 and CO (products of MDR), that transform in the oxidized species H2O and CO2 respectively. This reaction displaces dry reforming towards products what avoids carbon formation at some extent. Carbon deposition has been detected at temperatures lower than 900 degrees C. These deposits were partially removed along isothermal experiments, probably by CO2 (Boudouard), and/or newly formed H-2 and CO (MDR). EDS analysis demonstrated that carbon is mostly formed on the surface of nickel particles, while Raman spectroscopy shows that this carbon was highly graphitized. Metallic iron can be reoxidized with steam in a subsequent stage releasing high purity hydrogen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer from pain and joint disability. The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel expressed on sensory neurones and non-neuronal cells mediates pain transduction and inflammation and it has been implicated in RA. However, there is little information on the contribution of TRPA1 for human disease. Here, we investigated the expression of TRPA1 on peripheral blood leukocytes and the circulating levels of its endogenous activators 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in RA patients treated or not with the anti-rheumatic leflunomide (LFN) or the anti-TNF alpha adalimumab (ADA). We also assessed whether TRPA1 expression correlates with joint pain and disability, in addition to the immune changes in RA. TRPA1 expression on peripheral blood leukocytes correlated with pain severity and disability. TRPA1 levels on these cells were associated with the numbers of polymorphonuclear and the activation of CD14(+) cells. No correlations were found between the lymphocyte population and TRPA1 expression, pain or disability. Patients recently diagnosed with RA expressed increased levels of TRPA1 on their leukocytes whilst treatment with either LFN or ADA down-regulated this receptor probably by reducing the numbers of polymorphonuclears and the activation of CD14(+) cells. We suggest that the activation levels of CD14(+) cells, the numbers of PMNs in the peripheral blood and the expression of TRPA1 on peripheral blood leukocytes correlate with RA progression, affecting joint pain sensitivity and loss of function.

AB The specificity of the available experimentally determined structures of amyloid forms is expressed primarily by the two- and not three-dimensional forms of a single polypeptide chain. Such a flat structure is possible due to the beta structure, which occurs predominantly. The stabilization of the fibril in this structure is achieved due to the presence of the numerous hydrogen bonds between the adjacent chains. Together with the different forms of twists created by the single R- or L-handed alpha-helices, they form the hydrogen bond network. The specificity of the arrangement of these hydrogen bonds lies in their joint orientation in a system perpendicular to the plane formed by the chain and parallel to the fibril axis. The present work proposes the possible mechanism for obtaining such a structure based on the geometric characterization of the polypeptide chain constituting the basis of our early intermediate model for protein folding introduced formerly. This model, being the conformational subspace of Ramachandran plot (the ellipse path), was developed on the basis of the backbone conformation, with the side-chain interactions excluded. Our proposal is also based on the results from molecular dynamics available in the literature leading to the unfolding of alpha-helical sections, resulting in the beta-structural forms. Both techniques used provide a similar suggestion in a search for a mechanism of conformational changes leading to a formation of the amyloid form. The potential mechanism of amyloid transformation is presented here using the fragment of the transthyretin as well as amyloid A beta.

AB We present a joint experimental and quantum chemical study on the influence of solvent dynamics on the protonation equilibrium in a strongly hydrogen bonded phenol-acetate complex in CD2Cl2. Particular attention is given to the correlation of the proton position distribution with the internal conformation of the complex itself and with fluctuations of the aprotic solvent. Specifically, we have focused on a complex formed by 4-nitrophenol and tetraalkylammonium-acetate in CD2Cl2. Experimentally we have used combined low-temperature H-1 and C-13 NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy and showed that a very strong OHO hydrogen bond is formed with proton tautomerism (PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc and PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc forms, both strongly hydrogen bonded). Computationally, we have employed ab initio molecular dynamics (70 and 71 solvent molecules, with and without the presence of a counter-cation, respectively). We demonstrate that the relative motion of the counter-cation and the "free" carbonyl group of the acid plays the major role in the OHO bond geometry and causes proton "jumps", i.e. interconversion of PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc and PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc tautomers. Weak H-bonds between CH(CD) groups of the solvent and the oxygen atom of carbonyl stabilize the PhOH center dot center dot center dot-OAc type of structures. Breaking of CH center dot center dot center dot O bonds shifts the equilibrium towards PhO-center dot center dot center dot HOAc form.

ID STAINLESS-STEEL WELDS; HYDROGEN
AB Keyhole gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is a relatively new variant used for fabrication of pressure equipment where up to 10-mm-thick material can be autogenously welded in one pass. As the shielding gas used for keyhole mode is typically Ar + 5% H-2, the suitability of this method for welding of duplex stainless steels has been investigated. Duplex UNS S31803 and superduplex UNS S32750 schedule 40 seamless pipe was welded using a closed square butt joint configuration. Shielding gas compositions were applied with increasing nitrogen content in argon or argon-hydrogen mixtures. An investigation of the completed welds included examinations of the microstructure, corrosion and mechanical properties of the weld metal. All shielding gases resulted in high-quality welds free from defects, showed high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. Hydrogen additions increased the weld metal nitrogen loss and resulted in lower austenite formation. Ar + 5% H2 showed up to 20 vol.% less austenite than the gas types containing nitrogen and also showed the lowest impact toughness. At least 2% nitrogen would be recommended for optimizing the phase balance and impact toughness. Taking all aspects into account, Ar + 2% N-2 is the preferred shielding gas for welding duplex and superduplex with the keyhole GTAW process.

AB In this work we have found, that the water-soluble cis,mer-[IrH2Cl(mtppms)3] (mtppms = monosulfonated triphenylphosphine Na-salt) was an excellent catalyst for reduction of terminal alkynes by hydrogen transfer from aqueous HCOOH/HCOONa mixtures. The conversions strongly depended on the pH of the reaction mixtures, and the highest rate of phenylacetylene transfer hydrogenation was observed at pH 3. The same dihydrido-Ir(III) complex actively catalyzed also the hydrogenation of terminal alkynes under mild conditions (T = 50 ?C; P (H2) = 2?10 bar). Importantly, both the hydrogenation and hydrogen transfer reductions afforded exclusively the corresponding alkenes as products. Phenylacetylene and its substituted derivatives reacted smoothly, while benzylic and aliphatic alkynes were less reactive or did not react at all. It was also found, that an excess of the mtppms ligand inhibited the reaction. This was rationalized by formation of cisz-[IrH2(mtppms)4]+ which was also confirmed with multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. On the basis of the experimental results, a joint mechanism was suggested for both the hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation pathways. The mechanism of hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was also studied by DFT calculations, which revealed several possibilities for protonation of a vinyl intermediate as the crucial step in formation of the styrene product.

AB Thin-film transistors (TFTs) in practical operations are inevitably impacted by moisture and temperature. An investigation on the joint effect of environmental moisture and working temperature on device characteristics and instability is becoming necessary. However, few related studies have been performed. In this work, a low-temperature (LT) annealing in air is proposed to simulate the working conditions of TFTs in display applications. The effect of moisture exchange caused by LT annealing on device characteristics and instability of InSnZnO (ITZO) TFTs is systematically investigated. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, TCAD design simulation, and the measurement of relative humidity (RH) change on the device surface, a model considering water diffusion and water ionization is proposed. The negative shift of the transfer curve is attributed to the extra electrons released from the water ionization and the positive-bias-stress-induced instability is mainly attributed to the generation of interstitial/substitutional hydrogens and aggregation of hydrogen ions at the backchannel. The temperature and the RH on the device surface jointly determine the moisture diffusion direction. Furthermore, the model is verified by an LT vacuum annealing. The results and the model will be beneficial for the further reliable design of ITZO TFTs in commercial applications.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate a multilayer structure made of polyethylene and polyamide by rotational molding. Due to the different polarity of these polymers, it is difficult to ensure enough adhesion between created layers. Two methods leading to improve adhesion are introduced. Plasma modification of polyethylene powder, after which new functional groups are bound to the treated surface, may enhance specific adhesion by forming hydrogen bonds with-CONH groups of polyamide. Different strategies of adding material to the mold give rise to complicated interlayer which increases joint strength by mechanism of the mechanical adhesion. Mechanical tests show a significant improvement of joint strength, where treated samples reached two-fold values of peel strength (7.657 +/- 1.024 N center dot mm(-1)) against the untreated sample (3.662 +/- 0.430 N center dot mm(-1)). During bending test, delamination occurred only in samples that were made of the untreated polyethylene. Adding polyamide during the melting stage of polyethylene powder in rotomolding resulted in the formation of entanglements which improve the peel strength almost eight times in comparison with the sample where the polyethylene was left to completely melt and create smooth interlayer surface.

AB Conductive hydrogels are ideal materials for preparing wearable strain sensing devices due to their flexibility and stretchability. However, most hydrogels exhibit poor freezing resistance and weak water-holding ability, thus hindering the working range of hydrogel-based sensors in extreme environments. Here, a conductive hydrogel featuring conspicuous anti-freezing and water retention abilities was prepared by integrating amylose (AMY) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/glycerol/NaCl hydrogel. AMY possesses a number of hydroxyl groups, which could interact with PVA and glycerin via hydrogen bonds, enhancing the toughness of the hydrogel. Meanwhile, based on the strong hydrogen bonding between glycerol and water molecules, the hydrogel displayed water-retaining properties after 7 days of storage in an open environment. The synergistic action of NaCl and glycerol prevented the crystallization of water at low temperatures, endowing the hydrogel with outstanding conductivity and stretchability at -20 degrees C. Furthermore, the hydrogel-based wearable strain sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity (GF = 2.55), fast response/recovery time, and good durability and biocompatibility, which accurately detected joint movements and physiological signals at room temperature or under extreme conditions. Therefore, conductive hydrogels would possess significant application prospects in health detection, disease diagnosis, and artificial intelligence.

AB Genomic prediction (GP) offers great opportunities for accelerated genetic gains by optimizing the breeding pipeline. One of the key factors to be considered is how the training populations (TP) are composed in terms of genetic improvement, kinship/origin, and their impacts on GP. Hydrogen cyanide content (HCN) is a determinant trait to guide cassava's products usage and processing. This work aimed to achieve the following objectives: (i) evaluate the feasibility of using cross-country (CC) GP between germplasm's of Embrapa Mandioca e Fruticultura (Embrapa, Brazil) and The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA, Nigeria) for HCN; (ii) provide an assessment of population structure for the joint dataset; (iii) estimate the genetic parameters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a haplotype-approach. Datasets of HCN from Embrapa and IITA breeding programs were analyzed, separately and jointly, with 1,230, 590, and 1,820 clones, respectively. After quality control, similar to 14K SNPs were used for GP. The genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) were predicted based on SNP effects from analyses with TP composed of the following: (i) Embrapa genotypic and phenotypic data, (ii) IITA genotypic and phenotypic data, and (iii) the joint datasets. Comparisons on GEBVs' estimation were made considering the hypothetical situation of not having the phenotypic characterization for a set of clones for a certain research institute/country and might need to use the markers' effects that were trained with data from other research institutes/country's germplasm to estimate their clones' GEBV. Fixation index (F-ST) among the genetic groups identified within the joint dataset ranged from 0.002 to 0.091. The joint dataset provided an improved accuracy (0.8-0.85) compared to the prediction accuracy of either germplasm's sources individually (0.51-0.67). CC GP proved to have potential use under the present study's scenario, the correlation between GEBVs predicted with TP from Embrapa and IITA was 0.55 for Embrapa's germplasm, whereas for IITA's it was 0.1. This seems to be among the first attempts to evaluate the CC GP in plants. As such, a lot of useful new information was provided on the subject, which can guide new research on this very important and emerging field.

AB This study experimentally investigates the application of a novel high-entropy alloy (HEA) filler, Co10Cr8Cu20Fe6Mn27Ni29, developed through thermodynamic calculations, in the brazing of Hastelloy X under a hydrogen atmosphere with three distinct brazing durations of 60, 90, and 120 min. The HEA filler was synthesized via mechanical alloying over a period of 60 h. The characterization techniques, including x-ray diffraction (XRD), indicated a lattice strain of 0.01% and a reduction in crystallite size to 66.19 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed a melting temperature of 1116 degrees C for the HEA filler. The shear strength of the samples was evaluated, achieving a maximum value of 283 MPa at 60 min, representing the highest shear strength recorded in this investigation. The results indicated that the sluggish diffusion characteristics of high-entropy alloys may reduce undesirable interactions with the superalloy substrates during brazing at elevated temperatures, thereby inhibiting the formation of detrimental secondary phases through restricted interdiffusion at the joint interface. However, prolonged brazing times led to increased continuity and porosity of brittle chromium-manganese oxide compounds along the grain boundaries, potentially compromising joint performance.

AB Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is a key enzyme in glycolysis that catalyses the interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This simple reaction involves the shuttling of protons mediated by protolysable side chains. The catalytic power of TIM is thought to stem from its ability to facilitate the deprotonation of a carbon next to a carbonyl group to generate an enediolate intermediate. The enediolate intermediate is believed to be mimicked by the inhibitor 2-phosphoglycolate (PGA) and the subsequent enediol intermediate by phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH). Here, neutron structures of Leishmania mexicana TIM have been determined with both inhibitors, and joint neutron/X-ray refinement followed by quantum refinement has been performed. The structures show that in the PGA complex the postulated general base Glu167 is protonated, while in the PGH complex it remains deprotonated. The deuteron is clearly localized on Glu167 in the PGA-TIM structure, suggesting an asymmetric hydrogen bond instead of a low-barrier hydrogen bond. The full picture of the active-site protonation states allowed an investigation of the reaction mechanism using density-functional theory calculations.

AB With the development of science and technology, the need for high performance sensors is more and more urgent to deal with different needs and environments. In this study, a flexible strain sensor with performance of self-healing is developed based on porous nickel as conductive filler and polyurethane (PU) with hydrogen bonding, disulfide bond, and metal coordination bond as polymer matrix. Porous nickel is prepared by a new biotemplates method, and the effects of reaction temperature and concentration of NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O on the morphology of porous nickel are studied. Polyurethanes containing hydrogen bonding, disulfide bonds, and metal coordination bonds are prepared, and the mechanical properties and self-healing properties of polyurethanes with different contents of hard and soft segments are studied. A strain sensor is prepared by mixing porous nickel and polyurethane. The effect of filler content on mechanical properties, self-healing properties, and electrical self-healing properties is studied. The sensor is attached to the joints of human limbs, and the peak diagram of time-relative resistance changes is obtained through the cyclic and repeated movements of the limbs. The sensor has excellent sensitivity.

ID GAMMA-RAY BURSTS
AB The joint observation of core-collapse supernovae with gamma-ray bursts shows that jets can be launched in the aftermath of stellar core collapse, likely by a newly formed black hole that accretes matter from the star. Such gamma-ray bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a stellar progenitor that lost its hydrogen envelope before collapse. According to recent hypothesis, it is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse events even when the progenitors still retain their hydrogen envelopes; however, such jets are not able to burrow through the star and will be stalled into the interior of the progenitor star before escaping. These jets are called choked jets. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape the stellar envelope and could be observed. Here, we examine how multimessenger searches for high-energy neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae can detect or limit the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets. We find that a high fraction of jet production is already limited by previous observational campaigns. We explore possibilities with future observations using Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, IceCube, and Km3NET.

AB Subgrid correlation of mixture fraction, Z, and progress variable, c, is investigated using direct numerical dimulation (DNS) data of a hydrogen lifted jet flame. Joint subgrid behaviour of these two scalars are obtained using a Gaussian-type filter for a broad range of filter sizes. A joint probability density function (JPDF) constructed using single-snapshot DNS data is compared qualitatively with that computed using two independent -PDFs and a copula method. Strong negative correlation observed at different streamwise locations in the flame is captured well by the copula method. The subgrid contribution to the Z-c correlation becomes important if the filter is of the size of the laminar flame thickness or larger. A priori assessment for the filtered reaction rate using the flamelet approach with independent -PDFs and correlated JPDF is then performed. Comparison with the DNS data shows that both models provide reasonably good results for a range of filter sizes. However, the reaction rate computed using copula JPDF is found to have a better agreement with the DNS data for large filter sizes because the subgrid Z-c correlation effect is included.

AB New measurements are reported of the soot-temperature interaction in a turbulent non-premixed ethylene-hydrogen-nitrogen attached jet flame with an exit Reynolds number of 15,000. Spatially resolved, two-dimensional temperature and soot volume fractions were measured simultaneously using non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (NTLAF) and laser-induced incandescence (LII) techniques, respectively. The soot-temperature correlation is presented and analyzed through representative images of single-shot simultaneous temperature and soot volume fraction at various heights, as well as through joint probability density functions (PDFs) of soot volume fraction (SVF) and temperature. A strong influence of temperature on SVF is found, which is consistent with current understanding of their inter-dependence. Axial and radial plots of mean SVF categorized into temperature bands of 300 K are also reported. These reveal that, while the mean SVF is a function of both temperature and axial distance, the joint PDF depends only weakly on radial distance. The study highlights the value of the simultaneous measurements for understanding soot behavior in a turbulent environment and for model development and validation. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

AB Developing a meniscus substitute that meets high in vivo demands of toughness, anti-fatigue, and lubrication remains a great challenge. Herein, a zwitterionic polyurethane (PU) prepolymer is synthesized through the reaction of sulfobetaine-based diol, polycarbonate diol, and hexamethylene diisocyanate. The zwitterionic PU prepolymer is then chain-extended by adipic acid dihydrazide to form multiple hydrogen-bonded crosslinked zwitterionic supramolecular polyurethane. By regulating the hydrogen bonds in the hard segment and hydration under the aqueous environment, the introduced zwitterionic side group can significantly enhance the toughness, printability, and lubrication of PU elastomer. By using the fused deposition modeling three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, the zwitterionic PU meniscus scaffold with robustness, toughness and lubrication was customized without any other post-treatment. In swelling equilibrium, the printed zwitterion-PU construct demonstrates Young's modulus of 16.87 +/- 2.00 MPa, toughness of 19.90 +/- 5.94 MJ m(-3), tear energy of 12.51 +/- 1.57 kJ m(-2), and excellent fatigue resistance. The 3D-printed zwitterionic PU meniscus replacement is implanted into the rabbits' knee joint for 12 weeks with the in vivo result demonstrating an appealing capability to efficiently alleviate the cartilage surface wear.

AB We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of the gas-phase reactions between rhodium clusters Rh-n(+) (n=1-24) and small hydrocarbons. It is found that most Rh-n(+) clusters react with CH4 to form absorption products Rh-n(CH4)(1,2)(+) but Rh-3(+) reacts to form carbide indicative of complete dehydrogenation; Rh-2(+) reacts with CH4 to form partial dehydrogenation products Rh2CH2+ and Rh2C2H6+. The distinctive reactivity of Rh-3(+) is also found for the reactions with C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6, where the complete dehydrogenation product Rh3C2+ is also formed. Analysis of reaction kinetics demonstrates that the cooperation of three Rh atoms plays a key role in the dehydrogenation reaction. Notably, Rh-3(+) bears a large HOMO-LUMO gap and reasonable stablity, and the roughly equal contribution of electrostatic and orbital interactions provide advantages to form two symmetric Rh-H-C hydrogen bridge bonds which promote the synergic cluster catalysis for hydrogen atom transfer and C-H bond dissociation. The efficient dehydrogenation mediated by an Rh-3(+) cluster opens a window to design new catalysts for C-H activation.

AB The synthesis and the structural characterization of a cyclic hexapeptoid with four methoxyethyl and two propargyl side chains have disclosed the presence of a hydrate crystal form [form (I)] and an anhydrous crystal form [form (II)]. The relative amounts of form (I) and form (II) in the as-purified product were determined by Rietveld refinement and depend on the purification procedures. In crystal form (I), peptoid molecules assemble in a columnar arrangement by means of side-chain-to-backbone C=CH center dot center dot center dot OC hydrogen bonds. In the anhydrous crystal form (II), cyclopeptoid molecules form ribbons by means of backbone-to-backbone CH2 center dot center dot center dot OC hydrogen bonds, thus mimicking beta-sheet secondary structures in proteins. In both crystal forms side chains act as joints among the columns or the ribbons and contribute to the stability of the whole solid-state assembly. Water molecules in the hydrate crystal form (I) bridge columns of cyclic peptoid molecules, providing a more efficient packing.

AB The joint effect of Bacillus subtilis 26D endophytic bacteria and chitooligosaccharides (COSs) on the resistance of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) to the late blight causative agent Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Bary was studied. A twofold decrease in the area of late-blight lesions on potato leaves was revealed during the joint presowing treatment of minitubers with B. subtilis bacteria (10(8) cells/mL) with COSs (1 mg/L). Treatment with COSs was found to have similar protective effect on potato plants, but this was not observed with the use of only bacteria. The mechanisms of increased potato-plant resistance to P. infestans were associated with the activation of catalase, peroxidase, and hydrolases (amylase and protease) inhibitors, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and transcripts of genes encoding PR proteins: amylase inhibitor, basic protective protein (PR-1), chitinase (PR-3), protease inhibitor (PR-6), peroxidase (PR-9). The revealed activation of the gene expression of the main antimicrobial protein PR-1 (a marker of the development of systemic acquired resistance) and PR-6 (a marker of the development of induced systemic resistance) under the influence of combined treatment with B. subtilis and COSs indicates that the development of protective reactions in potato plants to the late blight pathogen in this case occurs synergistically, with the participation of various signaling pathways, in which B. subtilis prime protective genes, and COSs act as a trigger for their expression.

AB Based on quantum-mechanical path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the vibrational and hydrogen bond dynamics in liquid water is investigated. The instantaneous fluctuations in the frequencies of the O-H stretch modes are calculated using the wavelet method of time-series analysis, while the time scales of the vibrational spectral diffusion are determined from frequency-time correlation functions, joint probability distributions, and the slope of three-pulse photon echo. We find that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects leads not only to a redshift of the vibrational frequency distribution by around 130 cm(-1) but also to an acceleration of the vibrational dynamics by as much as 30%. In addition, quantum fluctuations also entail a significantly faster decay of correlation in the initial diffusive regime, which is in agreement with recent vibrational echo experiments.

AB Pseudocapacitors have been experimentally studied for many years in electric energy storage. However, first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitive behavior is still not satisfactory due to the complexity involved in modeling electrochemistry. In this paper, we applied joint density functional theory (JDFT) to simulate the pseudocapacitive behavior of RuO2, a prototypical material, in a model electrolyte. We obtained from JDFT a capacitive curve which showed a redox peak position comparable to that in the experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve. We found that the experimental turning point from double-layer to pseudocapacitive charge storage at low scan rates could be explained by the hydrogen adsorption at low coverage. As the electrode voltage becomes more negative, H coverage increases and causes the surface-structure change, leading to bended - OH bonds at the on-top oxygen atoms and large capacitance. This H coverage-dependent capacitance can explain the high pseudocapacitance of hydrous RuO2. Our work here provides a first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitance for RuO2 in particular and for transition-metal oxides in general.

AB In the review of the successful solar thermal electrochemical process (STEP) of acrylonitrile oxidation for the effective wastewater treatment, the process was actually driven by solar two fields-thermofield and electrofield, essentially activated and motivated for both thermochemistry and electrochemistry. In this paper, the synergistic system of solar three fields, induced by the primary photofield, and sub-thermofield and sub-electrofield, was designed and employed firstly for promoted the efficiency of the solar utilization and pollutant oxidation plus hydrogen production. With the correlative action, the three sub chemical processes were induced by the solar three fields. The action actually conducted a three-field synergy of solar energy with a combination of the thermo-activation, photo catalysis and electrochemistry of the pollutant oxidation. Exemplified by acrylonitrile, the solar oxidation plus hydrogen production was theoretically and experimentally investigated by the single-field, coupled two-fields and coupled three-fields patterns. The results indicated that the coupled three-field pattern achieved high efficiencies in the solar utilization and oxidative reaction plus the hydrogen production, which was superior to ones of the single or two fields. The solar thermofield enables that the activated acrylonitrile was apt to be thermally decomposed, greatly in favor of the subsequent photo- and electrooxidation. The photocatalytic efficiency driven by the single photofield was reached at a rate of 31.01%. The electrolysis efficiency powered by single electrofield gained a rate of 24.56%. For the combination of the solar three-field pattern, the oxidation efficiencies run up to a rates of 32.74%, 38.06%, 55.01% and 76.01% during 60 min at the 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C, 75 degrees C, respectively. Especially, a joint of the coupled field realized the 6.38 times of the COD removal rate of acrylonitrile in comparison with the single field pattern. Due to the easy anodic oxidation of acrylonitrile and operation under the high temperature, the cathodic reduction of water was enhanced for the production of hydrogen in the electrolysis of the less potential plus an addition of photocatalysis. The experimental data and mechanistic analysis significantly revealed that the system achieved such a synergetic action. The full mineralization plus the hydrogen production was attributed to a coupling and matching integration of the solar three fields and subchemistries. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB N-Doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have recently emerged as potential organic electronic materials. The function of such materials is determined not only by the intrinsic electronic properties of individual molecules but also by their supramolecular interactions in the solid state. Therefore, a proper characterization of the interactions between the individual units is of interest to materials science since they ultimately govern properties such as excitons and charge transfer. Here, we report a joint experimental and computational study of two azaphenanthrene dimers to determine the structure and the nature of supramolecular interactions in the aggregates. IR/UV double resonance experiments were carried out using far-and mid-infrared free-electron laser radiation. The experimental spectra are compared with quantum chemical calculations for the lowest-energy pi-stacked and hydrogen-bonded structures. The data reveal a preference of the pi-stacked structure for the benzo[f]quinoline and the phenanthridine dimer.

AB The water stable UiO-66(Zr)-(CO2H)(2) MOF exhibits a superprotonic conductivity of 2.3x10(-3)Scm(-1) at 90 degrees C and 95% relative humidity. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements combined with aMS-EVB3 molecular dynamics simulations were able to probe individually the dynamics of both confined protons and water molecules and to further reveal that the proton transport is assisted by the formation of a hydrogen-bonded water network that spans from the tetrahedral to the octahedral cages of this MOF. This is the first joint experimental/modeling study that unambiguously elucidates the proton-conduction mechanism at the molecular level in a highly conductive MOF.

AB Solec Spa is health resort in south-eastern Poland. Its unique balneorehabilitation significance worldwide is determined by chloride-iodine-sodium water with a high content of hydrogen sulphide. This water, classified as highly mineralized sodium-chloride (seltzer) sulphide, bromide, iodide, boron water, contains naturally approximately 0.9 g/l divalent sulphur compounds, which is the highest concentration noted among the mineral waters of the world. The effectiveness of the Solec waters is proven in: inflammatory and autoimmunological locomotor system diseases, degenerative joint disorders (osteoarthritis), post-traumatic and post-operative orthopedic diseases, skin diseases and allergic disorders. One of the main indications for balneotherapy in Solec Spa and Busko Spa is chronic brucellosis.

AB Adhesive 2-layer lamination joints of 18mass%Cr-8mass%Ni austenite stainless steel and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (18-8/CFRP) were prepared using a new adhesion method consisting of applying low dose of 0.13 MGy of homogeneous low energy electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) to connecting surfaces of the 18-8 and CFRP prior to assembly and hot-pressing in vacuum under atmospheric pressure of about 1 Pa for 2 h at 401 +/- 0.5 K. Although untreated 18-8/CFRP joint exhibited decent adhesion by hot-pressing, application of 0.13 MGy HLEBI dose apparently improved the adhesive force of peeling resistance (degrees F-p) of the 18-8/CFRP joint 145% at median accumulative peeling probability (P-p = 0.50) from 18.9 to 27.4 Nm(-1). In addition, the statistically lowest degrees F-p for safety design (F-s at P-p= 0) iterated by the 3-parameter Weibull equation was raised from zero for the untreated to 5.2 Nm(-1) for the 0.13 MGy samples indicating increased reliability by the HLEBI. The higher adhesive strength induced by HLEBI was explained by results of XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) observations of the peeled surface of 18-8 side of lamination with and without 0.13 MGy-HLEBI. 0.13 MGy-HLEBI slightly increased the number of C=C bonds instead of slightly decreasing the numbers of C-C, C-H and O=C-O bonds near 18-8/CFRP interface. In addition, both increasing oxygen atoms and decreasing hydrogen atoms strongly attributed to bonding force at interface of epoxy of 18-8/CFRP. Since the experimental data showed the optimum HLEBI dose was about 0.13 MGy, above which at 0.13 MGy the degrees F-p began to drop, carefulness in optimization was highly recommended when applying in industry to insure safety.

AB The demand for renewable energy has prompted an increasing interest in wind turbine technology, where efficient and reliable brake systems play a critical role in ensuring safety and performance. This study investigates the brazing process to join sintered iron to mild steel for wind turbine brake pad applications. The sintered iron components were synthesized using iron powder with an average particle size of 30 mu m and sintered at different temperatures under vacuum and hydrogen environments. Eutectic CuSil with added copper powder was employed as the brazing alloy to join the sintered iron and mild steel. The brazed joints were characterized using various techniques, including optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, X-ray diffractometer, and microhardness tester. The microhardness of the sintered iron was similar to 580 HV for SICV and similar to 620 HV for SICH due to oxide formation during processing. The microhardness of the braze joint was 72 HV, and mild steel exhibited 110 HV. Tribological testing was performed to analyze the wear behavior of the sintered iron specimens (before and after the brazing). SICH specimens showed a wear rate of 1.3 x 10-4 g/Nm, and SICV specimens exhibited a wear rate of 5.3 x 10-4 g/Nm. Brazing the sintered iron component (SICV) with mild steel using eutectic CuSil and a modified assembly method in a vacuum successfully achieved a satisfactory joint with improved wear resistance. The study emphasizes the potential of this approach for efficient and reliable brake pad fabrication for wind turbines.

AB In the ever-evolving field of hydrogen storage technologies, metal hydrides, especially those derived from intermetallic compounds, stand out as promising solutions for safe, efficient, and reliable hydrogen storage. Among these, AB3 compounds are noteworthy for exhibiting interesting characteristics such as high storage capacity. In this study, we investigate the Y0.88Ni3-xMnx system (x = 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; 0.8 and 1) due to its low density and fundamental interest. The compounds were synthesised by arc-melting followed by annealing at 1173 K for 3 days. X-ray diffraction revealed that the lattice parameters of the AB3 phase do not vary linearly with Mn content, suggesting a non-random distribution of Mn atoms. Given the limited scattering contrast between Mn and Ni in X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction was employed to determine Mn occupancy. Joint refinement of synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns showed that for Mn contents up to x = 0.3, Mn occupies both Y-sites within the [A2B4] subunits and Ni-sites within the [AB5] subunits. At higher Mn concentrations, Mn also occupies Ni-sites at the boundary between [A2B4] and [AB5] subunits. The evolution of lattice parameters strongly correlates with these variations in Mn occupancy. Notably, Y0.88Ni2.7Mn0.3 and Y0.88Ni2.6Mn0.4 exhibit nearly equal [AB5] and [A2B4] subunit volumes, making them strong candidates for reversible hydrogen. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to complement experimental results and reveal thermodynamic mechanism behind the dual-site substitution of Mn and Mn site occupancy behaviour with respect to Mn content across different sites.

AB Despite widespread use of antioxidants, reactive oxygen species have important functions in normal tissues. Herein, we present an example of a physiological role for free radicals, and in particular, reactive oxygen species, that are suppressed by anti-oxidants. Free radicals catalyze the degradation of hyaluronan in synovial fluid, a tissue in which hyaluronidase activity is barely detectable. Articular cartilage requires a low oxygen environment. The process of hyaluronan peroxidation consumes significant amounts of molecular oxygen, thus keeping the tension of oxygen in the joint at a low but physiologically critical level. One concern is the change in physical activity between day and night, with periods of joint hyperemia and ischemia, respectively. Increased oxygen and the resulting oxidative stress would lead to chondrocyte dysfunction and cartilage damage. A mechanism for keeping oxygen levels low is required. We postulate that a mechanism indeed exists for the removal of excess oxygen. High-molar-mass hyaluronan turnover in synovial fluid utilizes peroxidative degradation, during which oxygen is massively consumed. The peroxidation itself may be initiated by hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by chondrocyte mitochondria, that can diffuse into the synovial fluid. The resulting decrease in available oxygen down-regulates hyaluronan peroxidation. This in turn prevents excessive oxygen consumption. It appears that free radicals and reactive oxygen species may be components of normal physiology, particularly in the synovial fluid of joints and articular cartilage. It is suggested therefore that indiscriminate use of antioxidants, vigorously promoted currently by health professionals and the health industry, be approached with caution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of the Pd content (0-1 wt %) and the synthesis method (joint impregnation with Ni + Pd and Pd/Ni or Ni/Pd sequential impregnation) on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of Ni-Pd/CeZrO2/Al2O3 were studied in order to develop an efficient catalyst for the conversion of methane into hydrogen-containing gas. It was shown that variation in the palladium content and a change in the method used for the introduction of an active constituent into the support matrix make it possible to regulate the redox properties of nickel cations but do not affect the size of NiO particles (14.0 +/- 0.5 nm) and the phase composition of the catalyst ((gamma + delta)-Al2O3, CeZrO2 solid solution, and NiO). It was established that the activity of Ni-Pd catalysts in the reaction of autothermal methane reforming depends on the method of synthesis and increases in the following order: Ni + Pd < Ni/Pd < Pd/Ni. It was found that, as the Pd content of the Ni-Pd/CeZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst was decreased from 1 to 0.05 wt %, the ability for self-activation, high activity, and operational stability of the catalyst under the conditions of autothermal methane reforming remained unaffected: at 850 degrees C, the yield of hydrogen was similar to 70% at a methane conversion of similar to 100% during a 24-h reaction.

AB Herein, we investigated the effects of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) on photosynthesis, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) content, oxidative damage, and biomass accumulation of different tissues in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) planted in cinnamon soils. The photosynthetic or fluorescence parameters (except for the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration), chlorophyll content, RuBisCO content, and biomass of roots, stems, and leaves decreased at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages under the stress of DBP. Compared with the control, the content of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide in the roots, stems, and leaves increased with increasing DBP concentrations at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the roots, stems, and leaves increased under the 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) DBP treatments; however, no significant changes were observed under the 40 mg kg(-1) DBP treatment at the seedling stage (except for the SOD activity in roots). The increase in SOD and CAT activities in the roots, stems, and leaves with increasing DBP concentration at the jointing and booting stages suggested that an increase in the activities of these antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in defending against excess reactive oxygen species under DBP stress. The biomass of wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with an increase in DBP concentration, which was presumably caused by a decrease in photosynthesis and RuBisCO. The effect of DBP on wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with wheat growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Multiple antiseptics have been described for use in total joint arthroplasty infection, and the use of multiple antiseptic solutions during a single operation has been described. Our clinical experience is that chlorhexidine (CHX) and Dakin's solution (NaOCl) interact and form a precipitate. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this reaction could be replicated in a laboratory setting, and to determine if other commonly used antiseptics also visibly react when mixed.
   Methods: Four percent chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and 10% povidone-iodine (BTD) solutions were obtained and all possible combinations were mixed. Any visible reactions were noted and recorded, and a literature search was performed to characterize the reaction and products.
   Results: CHX and NaOCl, CHX and H2O2, and CHX and BTD reacted instantly, forming a precipitate. NaOCl and H2O2 reacted to produce a gas. NaOCl and BTD reacted and produced a color change. The literature review revealed that at least 2 of the reactions tested (CHX thorn NaOCl and NaOCl thorn H2O2) could result in byproducts toxic to humans.
   Conclusion: Surgeons must be aware of these interactions when using antiseptic solutions during procedures. Caution should be used combining or mixing antiseptics, and we recommend against concomitant introduction in a surgical wound. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims at exploring the dynamic couplings of flame morphology and explosion pressure evolution experimentally and theoretically. In the experiment, flame morphology and explosion pressure evolution under diffusional-thermal and hydrodynamic instability are recorded using high-speed schlieren photography and pressure transducer. In the theoretical calculation, the effects of cellular flame on the explosion pressure evolution are conducted using smooth flame, D = 2.0566, 2.1 and 7/3. The results demonstrate that the cellular flame formation of various equivalence ratios could be attributed to the fact Lewis number is less than unity on the lean side. The flame destabilization of Phi = 0.8 and 3.0 with increasing initial pressure is due to the decreasing flame thickness regardless of unchangeable thermal expansion ratio. Much smaller cells formation on the cellular flame surface as the explosion pressure rises could be attributed to the joint effect of the diffusional-thermal and hydrodynamic instability. Note that the explosion pressure evolution in spherical chamber is obviously underestimated assuming the flame surface is smooth during the hydrogen/air explosion. But the explosion overpressure is overpredicted significantly with D = 7/3. The theoretical overpressure with D = 2.1 is in satisfactory agreement with experimental results.

AB Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) uses a Zn-bound OH-/H2O mechanism to catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2. This catalysis also involves a separate proton transfer step, mediated by an ordered solvent network coordinated by hydrophilic residues. One of these residues, Tyr7, was previously shown to be deprotonated in the neutron crystal structure at pH 10. This observation indicated that Tyr7 has a perturbed pK(a) compared with free tyrosine. To further probe the pK(a) of this residue, NMR spectroscopic measurements of [C-13] Tyr-labeled holo HCA II (with active-site Zn present) were preformed to titrate all Tyr residues between pH 5.4-11.0. In addition, neutron studies of apo HCA II (with Zn removed from the active site) at pH 7.5 and holo HCA II at pH 6 were conducted. This detailed interrogation of tyrosines in HCA II by NMR and neutron crystallography revealed a significantly lowered pK(a) of Tyr7 and how pH and Tyr proximity to Zn affect hydrogen-bonding interactions.

AB In this study, we introduced a modified cathodic cage plasma deposition (CCPD) system to synthesize a Ti-Nb-C-N-based composite coating on AISI-4340 steel. This composite coating is widely applied in orthopedic joint implants due to its effective bioactivity and wear resistance. In the existing CCPD system, a metallic cathodic cage of a specific material is used to deposit the coating of such material. Thus, it cannot be used to deposit the coating of a composite material. Here, we inserted composite material rings (80% TiO2 + 10% Nb2O5 + 10% graphite) on the lid of the cathodic cage, where the cathodic cage holds these rings and works as a counter electrode for plasma generation. The composite coating is synthesized in nitrogen plasma at various temperatures (300-400 degrees C) and various hydrogen contents (20, 50, and 80%). It is observed that the hardness of AISI-4340 steel (280 HV0.25) can be increased up to 1430 HV0.25 for coating deposited at 400 degrees C and 50% hydrogen, which is 5 times higher than the untreated sample. The XRD pattern shows that composite coating consists of TiN, Ti2N, NbN, NbC, and TiO2. The contents of oxide phase TiO2 are reduced by adding hydrogen gas to the processing environment; thus, the nitride-based composite coating can be synthesized. The wear volume is significantly reduced by composite coating, specifically while using higher hydrogen contents and higher temperatures. This study shows that this modified CCPD system can improve the hardness and wear resistance by synthesizing this composite coating. In contrast with conventional techniques, separate metallic targets for each element in composite coating (titanium, niobium, and carbon targets) are not required, simple equipment, rough vacuum level are required, and high-processing efficiency are advantages of this system.

A novel method for thermodynamic calculation of steam gasification of iron makes it possible to predict the specific yield of hydrogen by 63% more than with coal gasification is developed. During experi-ments on Ekibastuz coal, it is obtained syngas with a ratio H2/CO = 6.0 which is 2-3 times higher than in traditional gasifiers. It is predicted that in the case of joint coal-iron gasification, a ratio of H2/CO will be higher. The melting unit produces combustible gas with a calorific value of 7.0 MJ/nm3 and allows coal-iron gasification in fuel-free mode. An assessment shows: with the maximum wholesale price of natural gas (NG) on the market at 0.062$/m3, and in equivalent characteristics in relation to the NG, the cost of syngas produced in the system will be 0.025$/m3, which is 2-3 times lower than the cost of NG in Kazakhstan.

AB Focusing on the self-assembly strategy of polymer chain structure, designing and synthesizing intelligent, tough and healable polymer materials is an effective way to meet the high-end applications of materials. Inspired by spider silk, we designed a preparation scheme for a repairable polyurethane-polyurea elastomer (IPAD-6.4) with an unprecedented mechanical toughness of 625.10 MJ/m(3) and elongation at break of 3756.56%. After repeated cyclic stretching, the elastic body can recover 92.85% of the dissipated energy in only 2 h. These results are achieved by the hierarchical hydrogen bonds formed by different groups and the reasonable covalent cross-linking network. Additionally, the elastomer shows excellent healing ability (repair efficiency similar to 102.77%). A flexible conductive composite film is prepared by simple physical assembly. The sensor can not only accurately detect the bending motion of human joints, but also has excellent antibacterial properties, which gives the material application potential in medical and engineering fields.

AB Magnesium hydride (MGH), a highly promising hydrogen-producing substance/additive for hydrogen production through its hydrolysis reaction, has the potential to enhance broiler production. However, before incorporating MGH as a hydrogen-producing additive in broiler feed, it is crucial to fully understand its impact on microbiota and metabolites. In vitro fermentation models provide a fast, reproducible, and direct assessment tool for microbiota metabolism and composition. This study aims to investigate the effects of MGH and coated-magnesium hydride (CMG) on fermentation characteristics, as well as the microbiota and metabolome in the culture of in vitro fermentation using cecal inocula from broilers. After 48 h of incubation, it was observed that the presence of MGH had a significant impact on various factors. Specifically, the content of N-NH3 decreased, while the total hydrogen gas and total SCFAs increased. Furthermore, the presence of MGH promoted the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Blautia, Coprobacillus, and Dysgonomonas. On the other hand, the presence of CMG led to an increase in the concentration of lactic acid, acetic acid, and valeric acid. Additionally, CMG affected the diversity of microbiota in the culture, resulting in an enrichment of the relative abundance of Firmicutes, as well as genera of Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Eubacterium. Conversely, the relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and pathogenic bacteria Shigella decreased. Metabolome analysis revealed that MGH and CMG treatment caused significant changes in 21 co-regulated metabolites, primarily associated with lipid, amino acid, benzenoids, and organooxygen compounds. Importantly, joint correlation analysis revealed that MGH or CMG treatments had a direct impact on the microbiota, which in turn indirectly influenced metabolites in the culture. In summary, the results of this study suggested that both MGH and coated-MGH have similar yet distinct positive effects on the microbiota and metabolites of the broiler cecal in an in vitro fermentation model.

SO MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS

ID HYDROGEN
AB Experimental results which prove indirectly MHD effects at water electrolysis in an external constant magnetic field presumably due to electron emission from the cathode at the gas-electrolyte interface have been obtained. The joint conductive action of the constant magnetic field on the electric current in the electrolyte and on the flow of charged particles moving over the surface of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles under different orientation of the current I and magnetic field B vectors is also considered. The paper presents images of forces acting when applying a constant magnetic field to the electrolyte and gas bubbles during electrolysis, which explain the occurrence of convective gas-liquid flows. It is shown that by changing the parameters of electrolysis, topography and orientation of the electrodes, the strength and direction of the constant magnetic field it is possible to control forced convection of electrolyte. Such convection assists in enhancing the efficiency of the water electrolysis process.

AB A new brazing process for thin-walled stainless steel was proposed by combining green and efficient Ni-Cr-P electrodeposition with brazing technology. Novel information was attained by analyzing the electrodeposited Ni-Cr-P interlayers and the brazed joints and characterizing them using a combination of advanced techniques. The incorporation mechanisms of impurities (i.e., oxygen and carbon) in the Ni-Cr-P interlayers electrodeposited from a Cr(III)-glycine solution were revealed. The oxygen mainly came from the Cr(III)-hydroxy complexes formed by the hydrolysis and olation between Cr(III) complexes and OH- ions near the cathode. Glycine did not directly participate in the cathode reactions but decomposed on the anode surface. These byproducts (carbonyl compounds) were directly incorporated into the interlayers in a molecular pattern, forming a weak link to the metallic chromium. Brazing test results showed that a certain amount of Cr2O3 powder, formed by the decomposition of chromium hydroxides in the interlayers under high-temperature catalysis, would cause the degradation of the brazed joints. Using the step-wise brazing method, the brazing sheets were first annealed to eliminate the impurities by utilizing the strong reducing effect of hydrogen and the weak link characteristics between carbonyl compounds and metallic chromium atoms. An excellent joint with a shear strength of 63.0 MPa was obtained by subsequent brazing. The microstructural analysis showed that the brazed seam was mainly composed of a Ni-Fe-Cr solid solution, the Ni3P eutectic phase, and small quantities of the Ni5P2 phase scattered in the Ni3P eutectic phase. Fracture mode observations showed that the cracks extended along the interface between the brittle P-containing phase and the primary phase, resulting in fracture.

TI Attraction between Like Charged Ions in Ionic Liquids: Unveiling the
   Enigma of Tetracyanoborate Anions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Intermolecular interactions in ionic liquids are mainly governed by Coulombic forces. Attraction between cations has been previously observed and was attributed to dispersion interactions between nonpolar moieties, hydrogen bonding, or pi stacking. In this study, we present the intriguing behavior of tetracyanoborate anions in ionic liquids that, unlike their dicyanamide and tricyanomethanide counterparts, form dimers in both solid and liquid phases. A joint simulation and experimental study uncovers the origin of such anion-anion attraction: stabilization by induction and dispersion forces between several cyano groups, which is strong enough to overcome electrostatic repulsion. These findings open up new opportunities in the rational design of ionic liquids, where interactions between ions of the same charge can be controlled and fine-tuned by the presence of cyano groups.

TI Determining structural and chemical heterogeneities of surface species

DT Article
AB The structure determination of surface species has long been a challenge because of their rich chemical heterogeneities. Modern tip-based microscopic techniques can resolve heterogeneities from their distinct electronic, geometric, and vibrational properties at the single-molecule level but with limited interpretation from each. Here, we combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM), and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) to characterize an assumed inactive system, pentacene on the Ag(110) surface. This enabled us to unambiguously correlate the structural and chemical heterogeneities of three pentacene-derivative species through specific carbon-hydrogen bond breaking. The joint STM-AFM-TERS strategy provides a comprehensive solution for determining chemical structures that are widely present in surface catalysis, on-surface synthesis, and twodimensional materials.

TI Multiphoton Ionization Reduction of Atoms in Two-Color Femtosecond Laser

ID HARMONIC-GENERATION; MOLECULES; MOMENTUM
AB We report the ionization reduction of atoms in two-color femtosecond laser fields in this joint theoretical -experimental study. For the multiphoton ionization of atoms using a 400 nm laser pulse, the ionization probability is reduced if another relatively weak 800 nm laser pulse is overlapped. Such ionization reduction consistently occurs regardless of the relative phase between the two pulses. The time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulation results indicate that with the assisted 800 nm photons the electron can be launched to Rydberg states with large angular quantum numbers, which stand off the nuclei and thus are hard to be freed in the multiphoton regime. This mechanism works for hydrogen, helium, and probably some other atoms if two-color laser fields are properly tuned.

AB Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is a rare, dominant genetic disorder affecting bone and cartilage development, characterized by short-limb short stature, brachydactyly, loose joints, joint stiffness, and pain. The disorder is caused by mutations in the COMP gene, which encodes a protein that plays a role in the formation of collagen fibers. In this study, we present the clinical and genetic characteristics of PSACH in two Chinese families. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis revealed two novel missense variants in the COMP gene: NM_000095.3: c.1319G>T (p.G440V, maternal) and NM_000095.3: c.1304A>T (p.D435V, paternal-mosaic). Strikingly, both the G440V and D435V mutations were located in the same T3 repeat motif and exhibited the potential to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Upon further analysis using Missense3D and PyMOL, we ascertained that these mutations showed the propensity to disrupt the protein structure of COMP, thus hampering its functioning. Our findings expand the existing knowledge of the genetic etiology underlying PSACH. The identification of new variants in the COMP gene can broaden the range of mutations linked with the condition. This information can contribute to the diagnosis and genetic counseling of patients with PSACH.

AB In recent years, smart textiles and flexible wearable products have garnered significant attention in fields such as human-computer interaction, medical rehabilitation training, and motion monitoring. Flexible pressure sensors have attracted significant attention due to their excellent flexibility, stability, and multifunctional integration. Herein, a multifunctional wearable MXene/polydopamine (PDA)@cotton fabric pressure sensor was developed by modifying weft-knitted cotton fabric based on a dual hydrogen bond self-assembly strategy. The MXene/PDA@cotton fabric pressure sensor demonstrates wide linear detection range (0-146 kPa), high sensitivity (0.95 kPa-1), fast response/recovery times (16.434 and 11.952 ms), and outstanding stability after over 5000 cyclic tests. This sensor can achieve the monitoring of physiological parameters for human state detection, such as facial expression signals, abdominal respiratory signals, and joint bending signals. Furthermore, by integrating the MXene/PDA sensors into the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of a cotton glove, combined with intelligent algorithms and the human-computer interaction system, static gesture recognition and dynamic sign language translation were successfully realized based on the smart glove. This work demonstrates the potential application of flexible pressure sensors in intelligent human-computer interaction, providing new insights for developing next-generation sign language recognition systems.

AB The coexistence of glyphosate and copper is widely found in bodies of water and terrestrial ecosystems due to widespread application of herbicides and heavy metal. However, their joint ecotoxicological risks in aquatic environments remain unknown. The experiment investigated the individual and combined effects of glyphosate and copper on the growth and physiological response in Salvinia natans (L.) All. The results showed that their joint toxicity is related to concentration. Antagonistic effects were induced when plants were exposed to low concentrations of glyphosate and copper (<= 1 + 0.2 mg l(-1)). Synergistic effects were elicited at higher doses (>= 5 + 1 mg l(-1)). In addition, increased hydrogen peroxide levels indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress at individual or combined exposures. To cope with oxidative stress, S. natans can activate the antioxidant defense systems, including increased superoxide dismutase and changes in peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. High concentrations of combined pollution exceed the oxidative defense capabilities of plants, and therefore, malondialdehyde content increased significantly. Our results indicated that the ecotoxicity of glyphosate or copper may be exacerbated in aquatic environments and caused obvious damage to S. natans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report on a joint theoretical and experimental investigation into the electron-induced fragmentation of 2-chloroadenine, for electrons up to 12 eV. Elastic scattering calculations indicate an anion spectrum comprising a sigma(CCl)* and four pi* shape resonances, where the latter are systematically stabilised when compared to the analogue states of adenine. The measured ion yields indicate strong signals associated with the elimination of neutral hydrogen (peaking at 0.8 eV and with milder structures up to 2 eV), chloride ions and hydrochloric acid (both observed at around 0.2 and 0.9 eV). Bound state calculations indicate that the main feature for hydrogen abstraction arises from a vibrational Feshbach resonance on a dipole-bound state coupled to a sNH* state, while the pi(2)* and pi(3)* resonances initiate this fragmentation process in the 1-2 eV region. On the other hand, the C-Cl bond cleavage would mainly arise from the formation of the pi(1)* and pi(2)* resonances, which couple to the dissociative sigma(CCl)* state. Our results show that 2-chloroadenine efficiently dissociates into reactive species upon electron attachment, corroborating its potential as a radiosensitising drug.

TI The effect of four methods of surface activation for improved adhesion

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES
LA English
DT Article
DE Wood Plastic Composites; Lap shear; Surface treatment; Adhesion
AB Wood Polymer Composites (WPCs) have attracted a lot of interest in recent years as materials with a high renewable content. However the adhesion between WPC components is problematic because of low surface energy and the hydrophobic nature of the most widely used polymer matrices, i.e. polyolefins. Thus this paper has looked at four surface activation pretreatment methods to improve adhesion properties for bonding using epoxy adhesives, namely: hydrogen peroxide solution; hot air; a gas flame; and halogen heating lamps. The treatments were applied to WPC materials made from 60% wood flour in a polypropylene matrix, and lap joint shear strength was measured.
   Shear strength values showed that all treatments except the halogen heating lamps increased the bond strength and the best results were achieved with hydrogen peroxide treatment at a pH of 7.5 (37% improvement); a two pass hot air treatment at a pass speed of 75 mm s(-1) (44% improvement); and a gas flame treatment at a pass speed of 175 mm s(-1)(41% improvement).The bond strength was increased to values that caused failure within the material, rather than at the interfaces of the bond line.

DE Hydrogen embrittlement; Residual stress; Welds; Heat affected zone;

ID STEELS
AB Fatigue crack growth rates (FCGR) of multiple X100 pipeline steel welds and heat affected zones were measured in high-pressure hydrogen gas to investigate their behavior compared to lower strength pipeline welds. A total of five high strength welds and two heat affected zones (HAZ) were examined all of which were fabricated using the same X100 base material. Different welding wires and techniques were used to fabricate the welds to provide a variety of end products to evaluate susceptibility to fatigue in high pressure hydrogen gas. Residual stresses were measured for each weld and HAZ using the slitting method and the effect of residual stress on the stress intensity factor, K-res, was determined. Using K-res, the fatigue crack growth rate curves were corrected to remove the effects of residual stress by examining the influence of K-res on stress ratio, R. Comparisons were then made between the high strength welds, which were corrected for residual stress, and lower strength welds from the literature. It was found that the higher strength welds and heat affected zones exhibited comparable fatigue crack growth rates to lower strength welds, as the FCGR data of the high strength welds overlaid the lower strength welds. This suggests that despite distinct differences in strength and microstructure between the different welds, hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth susceptibility is similar. A comparison was made between the K-res measured in extracted coupons and residual stress estimates provided in relevant welded pipe assessment standards such as API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. It was found the residual stress values in the test coupons extracted from welded pipe were significantly lower than those expected in the intact welded pipes and highlights the importance in quantifying and removing coupon residual stresses when fatigue crack growth rates are measured and including expected weld joint residual stress when making structural assessments.

AB Significance: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a ubiquitous small gaseous signaling molecule, plays a critical role in various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) via reducing inflammation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Recent Advances: Uncontrolled inflammation is closely related to pathological process of ischemic stroke, RA, MI, and IBD. Solid evidence has revealed the axes between gut and other organs like joint, brain, and heart, and indicated that H2S-mediated anti-inflammatory effect against IBD, RA, MI, and ischemic stroke might be related to regulating the functions of axes between gut and other organs.<br /> Critical Issues: We reviewed endogenous H2S biogenesis and the H2S-releasing donors, and revealed the anti-inflammatory effects of H2S in IBD, ischemic stroke, RA, and MI. Importantly, this review outlined the potential role of H2S in the gut-joint axis, gut-brain axis, and gut-heart axis as a gasotransmitter.<br /> Future Direction: The rate, location, and timing of H2S release from its donors determine its potential success or failure as a useful therapeutic agent and should be focused on in the future research. Therefore, there is still a need to explore internal and external sources monitoring and controlling H2S concentration. Moreover, more efficient H2S-releasing compounds are needed; a better understanding of their chemistry and properties should be further developed. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 00, 000-000.

AB Optical pumping of molecules provides unique opportunities for control of chemical reactions at a wide range of rotational energies. This work reports a chemical reaction with extreme rotational excitation of a reactant and its kinetic characterization. We investigate the chemical reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction SiO+ + H-2 & RARR; SiOH+ + H in an ion trap. The SiO+ cations are prepared in a narrow rotational state distribution, including super-rotor states with rotational quantum number (j) as high as 170, using a broad-band optical pumping method. We show that the super-rotor states of SiO+ substantially enhance the reaction rate, a trend reproduced by complementary theoretical studies. We reveal the mechanism for the rotational enhancement of the reactivity to be a strong coupling of the SiO+ rotational mode with the reaction coordinate at the transition state on the dominant dynamical pathway.
   Control of chemical reactivity through excitation of rotational states is a relatively unexplored process that may play a role in interstellar chemistry. Here the authors show a marked acceleration of the hydrogen abstraction reaction between SiO+ and H-2 by exciting super-rotor states of SiO+, in a joint experimental and theoretical study.

AB Chemical reaction dynamics needs the joint effort from both experiment and theory, and theory is useful to rationalize the experimental results by offering intimate details of chemical reaction dynamics and to explore new reaction pathways. With the aid of machine learning, we develop here an accurate full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for the reaction between Cl + SiH4. This PES can describe well the hydrogen abstraction channel to HCl + SiH3. It can also give a good description for the hydrogen substitution channel to H + SiH3Cl, which is the focus of the current study and has never been reported by theory. The dynamics of this substitution channel is revealed in detail by calculating ample quasi-classical trajectories (QCTs) on the new PES. The computed product angular distributions are in good agreement with the only crossed molecular beam experiment. Both theory and experiment suggest that this channel takes place mainly via the typical S(N)2 inversion mechanism. Theory reveals that there also exists a novel torsion mechanism for the substitution channel. Two dynamic mechanisms are analyzed in detail. The present detailed theoretical dynamics study sheds insightful and novel understanding for this fundamentally important chemical reaction.

AB Apremilast (APR), an anti-psoriatic agent, easily forms isostructural cocrystals and solvates with aromatic entities, often disobeying at the same time Kitaigorodsky's rule as to the saturation of possible hydrogen-bonding sites. In this paper the reasons for this peculiar behavior are investigated, employing a joint experimental and theoretical approach. This includes the design of cocrystals with coformers having a high propensity towards the formation of both aromatic-aromatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, determination of their structure, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, as well as calculations of stabilization energies of formation of the obtained cocrystals, followed by crystal structure prediction calculations and solubility measurements. The findings indicate that the stabilization energies of cocrystal formation are positive in all cases, which results from strain in the APR conformation in these crystal forms. On the other hand, solubility measurements show that the Gibbs free energy of formation of the apremilast:picolinamide cocrystal is negative, suggesting that the formation of the studied cocrystals is entropy driven. This entropic stabilization is associated with the disorder observed in almost all known cocrystals and solvates of APR.

AB Slag-discharge lock hopper is a critical equipment in the slag-water system of Coal gasification hydrogen production technology. To investigate the characteristics of liquid-solid two-phase flow and stress distribution during the discharging process of an intermittent slag-discharge system, this study established an experimental platform for slag-discharge lock hopper and conducted dynamic discharging experiments. The effects of flushing water flow rate, initial height of the material, and material particle size on the phenomena of liquid-solid twophase flow and stress distribution in the slag-discharge lock hopper discharging process were studied. The relationship among the material discharge rate, flow pattern transformation and wall normal stress during the discharging process of slag lock hopper is studied. Results indicate that as the flushing water flow rate increases, the average discharge rate increases, but the increase trend of discharge rate gradually slows down. Additionally, the normal stress on the wall of the cylinder-cone joint part fluctuates slightly, and the overpressure coefficient at the outlet part increases first and then decreases slowly. As the initial material height increases, the average discharge rate initially rises and then decreases, and the phenomenon of wall overpressure becomes more obvious. As the particle size of the material increases, the average discharge rate decreases, and the change in normal stress on the wall at the cylinder-cone joint part becomes more pronounced, manifesting in a heightened frequency of overpressure phenomenon.

AB Developing a high-performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires a comprehensive consideration of the three key factors, that is, intrinsic activity, electric conductivity, and active site number. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a self-supported Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface microsphere as a highly active and low-cost catalyst for alkaline HER, which has simultaneously addressed these key issues by a joint application of heterointerface construction and defect and architecture engineering strategies. Our density functional theory calculations revealed Ni2P and WO2.83 optimized by the interface coupling effect work in concert to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Importantly, the metalloid Ni2P in an intimate combination with the oxygen-defect-rich WO2.83 species endowed the electrocatalyst with high conductivity. Furthermore, the Ni2P/WO2.83 electrocatalyst presented a superhydrophilic nanostructure, ensuring abundant active sites and their accessibility. Benefiting from these attributes, the obtained Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface electrocatalyst exhibited excellent activity along with favorable stability for alkaline HER, especially at high current density, surpassing the most reported non-precious catalysts.

AB Alamethicin, a peptide consisted of 20 amino acid residues, has been known to function as an antibiotic. The peptides self-associate in biological membranes, form an ion channel, and then induce cell death by leaking intracellular contents through a transmembrane pore of an ion channel. We investigated conformation and its thermal stability of alamethicin-A6 and -U6 in ethanol using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; alamethicin-A6 and -U6 have the amino acid sequences of UPUAUAQUVUGLUPVUUQQO and UPUAUUQUVUGLUPVUUQQO, respectively, where U and O represent alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and phenylalaninol, respectively. As indicated by the under bars in the sequences, only the residue 6 differs between the alamethicins. We show that the alamethicins in ethanol form helix conformation in the region of the residues 2-11 and a non-regular conformation in the regions of the N- and C-termini, and that the helices are maintained up to 66 degrees C at least. Conformations in the region of the residues 12-18 of the alamethicins, however, are not well identified due to the lack of NMR data. In addition, we demonstrate that the amide proton chemical shift temperature coefficients' method, which is known as an indicator for intramolecular hydrogen bonds in peptides and proteins in aqueous solutions, can be also applied to the alamethicins in ethanol. Further, we show that the conformation around the C-terminus of alamethicin-A6 is restrained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas that of alamethicin-U6 is either restrained or unrestrained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds; the alamethicin-U6 molecules having the restrained and unrestrained conformations coexist in ethanol. We discuss the two types of conformations using a model chain consisting of particles linked by rigid bonds called as the free jointed chain.
